# Future Roadmap

Based on the hive-mind analysis and user feedback, here are planned enhancements for the AI Terminal Orchestrator.

## Phase 1: Enhanced Dashboard (Priority: High)

### Rich Terminal Dashboard
As recommended by the hive-mind analysis, implement a status dashboard to handle many workers:

```rust
// Using ratatui for terminal UI
pub struct DashboardPane {
    // Worker overview
    total_workers: usize,
    active_workers: Vec<WorkerSummary>,
    completed_tasks: Vec<CompletedTask>,
    
    // System metrics
    cpu_usage: f32,
    memory_usage: f32,
    
    // Task queue
    pending_tasks: VecDeque<Task>,
}
```

**Features:**
- Real-time worker status with progress bars
- Task queue visualization
- Resource usage monitoring
- Clickable interface (mouse support in terminal)

## Phase 2: Web UI Alternative (Priority: High)

### Browser-Based Interface
For scenarios with >10 workers or remote access needs:

```typescript
interface OrchestrationUI {
  // Three-panel layout similar to tmux
  primaryTerminal: XTerminal;
  orchestratorStatus: StatusPanel;
  workerGrid: WorkerGrid;
  
  // Enhanced features
  taskHistory: TaskHistory;
  resourceMonitor: ResourceMonitor;
  collaborationTools: CollaborationPanel;
}
```

**Benefits:**
- Unlimited worker display with virtual scrolling
- Rich visualizations (graphs, charts)
- Remote accessibility
- Multi-user support

## Phase 3: Intelligent Orchestration (Priority: Medium)

### Smart Worker Allocation
```rust
pub struct IntelligentOrchestrator {
    // ML-based task analysis
    task_classifier: TaskClassifier,
    
    // Historical performance data
    worker_performance: PerformanceDB,
    
    // Resource predictor
    resource_estimator: ResourceEstimator,
}

impl IntelligentOrchestrator {
    pub async fn plan_optimal_workers(&self, task: &str) -> Vec<WorkerPlan> {
        // Analyze task complexity
        let complexity = self.task_classifier.analyze(task);
        
        // Predict resource needs
        let resources = self.resource_estimator.estimate(&complexity);
        
        // Select optimal worker configuration
        self.optimize_worker_allocation(complexity, resources)
    }
}
```

### Features:
- Task complexity analysis
- Historical performance learning
- Dynamic worker type selection
- Resource usage prediction

## Phase 4: Advanced Communication (Priority: Medium)

### Multi-Protocol Support
```rust
pub enum CommunicationProtocol {
    UnixSocket,      // Current
    WebSocket,       // Remote access
    gRPC,           // Structured RPC
    MessageQueue,   // Async patterns
    SharedMemory,   // High performance
}

pub struct ProtocolAdapter {
    protocols: HashMap<String, Box<dyn Protocol>>,
    
    pub fn route_message(&self, msg: Message) -> Result<()> {
        let protocol = self.select_optimal_protocol(&msg);
        protocol.send(msg)
    }
}
```

### Features:
- Automatic protocol selection
- Fallback mechanisms
- Encryption support
- Compression for large payloads

## Phase 5: Enterprise Features (Priority: Low)

### Multi-Tenancy Support
```rust
pub struct EnterpriseOrchestrator {
    tenants: HashMap<TenantId, TenantContext>,
    resource_quotas: QuotaManager,
    audit_log: AuditLogger,
}
```

### Features:
- User authentication and authorization
- Resource quotas per user/team
- Audit logging for compliance
- Priority queuing
- Cost tracking

### Collaboration Tools
- Shared orchestration sessions
- Real-time cursor presence
- Voice/video integration
- Code review workflows

## Phase 6: AI Enhancements (Priority: Future)

### Advanced AI Integration
```rust
pub struct AIEnhancedOrchestrator {
    // Multiple AI providers
    providers: Vec<Box<dyn AIProvider>>,
    
    // Intelligent routing
    router: AIRouter,
    
    // Result synthesis
    synthesizer: ResultSynthesizer,
}
```

### Features:
- Multi-provider support (Claude, GPT, Gemini, etc.)
- Intelligent provider selection
- Result synthesis from multiple workers
- Automatic error correction
- Learning from user feedback

## Community Contributions Welcome

We're looking for help with:

1. **UI/UX Design**: Dashboard layouts and web interface
2. **AI Integration**: Additional AI provider adapters
3. **Testing**: Load testing with many workers
4. **Documentation**: Tutorials and examples
5. **Plugins**: Extended worker types

## Research Areas

### Performance Optimization
- Worker pooling strategies
- Memory-efficient terminal buffers
- Optimal pane layouts
- GPU acceleration for AI

### Novel Interfaces
- AR/VR terminal environments
- Voice-controlled orchestration
- Gesture-based worker management
- Brain-computer interfaces (yes, really!)

## Breaking Changes

As we evolve the architecture, some breaking changes may occur:

1. **v2.0**: New dashboard-based layout
2. **v3.0**: Web UI as primary interface
3. **v4.0**: Cloud-native orchestration

We'll maintain backwards compatibility where possible and provide migration guides.
