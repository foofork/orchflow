# OrchFlow Terminal Interface - Summary

## Core Concept
Replace unix-style keyword commands with natural conversation between the user and Claude in the primary terminal, while complex work is distributed to worker terminals managed by an intelligent orchestrator.

## Three-Tier Architecture

### 1. Primary Terminal (User Interface)
- **What it does**: Natural conversation with Claude + system visibility
- **Key principle**: Never blocked by long-running work
- **Features**:
  - Natural language input/output
  - Live system overview dashboard
  - Direct access to inspect any worker
  - Simple commands: "show me what's running", "pause that", "let me see worker 2"

### 2. Orchestrator Terminal (Coordination Layer)
- **What it does**: Intelligent work scheduling and worker management
- **Key principle**: Handles all complexity behind the scenes
- **Features**:
  - Analyzes task dependencies
  - Schedules parallel vs sequential execution
  - Spawns appropriate worker types (swarms, hive-minds, tasks)
  - Manages worker lifecycle (start/pause/resume/stop)
  - Prevents resource conflicts
  - Enables inter-worker communication

### 3. Worker Terminals (Execution Layer)
- **What it does**: Execute actual work in isolation
- **Key principle**: Each runs full claude-code instance
- **Features**:
  - Can be inspected and chatted with while running
  - Pauseable and resumeable
  - Can spawn their own sub-swarms/hive-minds
  - Run in tmux panes for easy access

## Key Benefits

1. **Zero Learning Curve**: Users speak naturally, no commands to memorize
2. **Always Responsive**: Primary terminal never blocked
3. **Full Visibility**: See everything that's happening
4. **Interactive Control**: Connect to any worker, pause/resume/stop as needed
5. **Intelligent Coordination**: Orchestrator optimizes execution automatically

## Example Interaction

```
User: "I need to refactor the auth module to use JWT"
Claude: "I'll set up a refactoring team for that. Starting now..."

User: "Show me what's running"
Claude: [Shows dashboard with all active workers, progress bars, and status]

User: "Let me see what worker 1 is doing"
Claude: [Connects to worker's Claude instance for direct interaction]

User: "Pause the docs generator"
Claude: "Paused at 90% complete. You can resume anytime."
```

## Implementation Approach

1. **Primary Terminal**: Initialize claude-code with MCP tools for orchestrator control
2. **Orchestrator**: Build dependency graph, scheduler, and worker spawning engine
3. **Workers**: Each runs `npx claude-flow` with appropriate configuration
4. **Communication**: MCP tools for primary↔orchestrator, IPC for orchestrator↔workers

## Next Steps

1. Implement MCP tool registration for orchestrator commands
2. Build worker spawning and lifecycle management
3. Create system overview dashboard
4. Add worker inspection capability
5. Implement natural language intent recognition
6. Test with real claude-flow swarms and hive-minds
