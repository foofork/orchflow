üéØ Comprehensive Build Commands for OrchFlow

  Option 1: Full Autonomous Build (Single Command)

  npx claude-flow@2.0.0-alpha.50 swarm "Build the complete OrchFlow system following the blueprint in 
  /workspaces/orchflow/demos/ai-orchestrator/TECHNICAL_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md

  CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
  1. Create NPM package @orchflow/claude-flow as described in ORCHFLOW_DISTRIBUTION_FINAL.md
  2. The package must wrap claude-flow and intercept ONLY the 'orchflow' command
  3. Pass through all other claude-flow commands unchanged  
  4. Download Rust binaries on first use to ~/.orchflow/components/
  5. Implement the complete system from the TECHNICAL_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md

  KEY SECTIONS TO IMPLEMENT:
  - Lines 83-111: Implementation roadmap phases
  - Lines 346-515: Primary Terminal implementation
  - Lines 516-691: Orchestrator implementation  
  - Lines 692-882: Worker Terminal implementation
  - Lines 1598-1650: Complete main.ts entry point
  - Lines 1840-1927: Status Pane implementation
  - Lines 1928-2029: Worker Access Management

  ARCHITECTURE REQUIREMENTS:
  - 70/30 split screen (primary terminal / status pane)
  - MCP tools for Claude to control orchestrator
  - Descriptive worker names (e.g., 'JWT Auth Builder')
  - Natural language access to workers
  - Quick access keys 1-9
  - Never block primary terminal

  REFERENCE DOCS:
  - ORCHFLOW_DISTRIBUTION_FINAL.md: NPM wrapper approach
  - ORCHFLOW_CODING_STANDARDS.md: Tech stack (TypeScript + Rust)
  - VISIBILITY_DESIGN.md: Status pane details
  - WORKER_TERMINAL_ACCESS_GUIDE.md: Worker interaction

  TEST: The final system must work with:
  npm install -g @orchflow/claude-flow
  claude-flow orchflow" --max-agents 8 --strategy development --monitor

  Option 2: Phased Implementation (Better for 2200 lines)

  Phase 1: NPM Wrapper & Distribution

  npx claude-flow@2.0.0-alpha.50 sparc run developer "Create the @orchflow/claude-flow NPM wrapper package.

  SPECIFICATIONS FROM DOCS:
  1. Read ORCHFLOW_DISTRIBUTION_FINAL.md for complete distribution strategy
  2. Read TECHNICAL_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md lines 1598-1650 for entry point
  3. Create package structure:
     - package.json with bin: { 'claude-flow': './bin/claude-flow.js' }
     - bin/claude-flow.js that intercepts 'orchflow' command
     - src/component-manager.ts for binary downloads
     - src/orchflow.ts main entry point

  The wrapper must:
  - Intercept: claude-flow orchflow ‚Üí launch OrchFlow
  - Pass through: claude-flow [anything-else] ‚Üí real claude-flow
  - Download Rust binaries on first 'orchflow' use
  - Store binaries in ~/.orchflow/components/

  Test with: npm link && claude-flow orchflow (should show 'downloading components...')"

  Phase 2: Core Terminal Interface

  npx claude-flow@2.0.0-alpha.50 sparc run developer "Implement OrchFlow's terminal interface.

  SPECIFICATIONS:
  1. Primary Terminal (lines 346-515 of TECHNICAL_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md):
     - Create OrchFlowTerminal class with MCP integration
     - Natural language conversation with Claude
     - Never blocked by long tasks
     
  2. Status Pane (lines 1840-1927):
     - 30% width real-time status display
     - Show descriptive worker names
     - Progress bars and resource usage
     - Quick access keys 1-9

  3. Terminal Layout:
     - Use tmux to create 70/30 split
     - Left: Primary terminal with Claude
     - Right: Status pane with worker list

  Reference VISIBILITY_DESIGN.md for exact status pane layout"

  Phase 3: Orchestration Engine

  npx claude-flow@2.0.0-alpha.50 sparc run developer "Build the OrchFlow orchestration engine.

  SPECIFICATIONS from TECHNICAL_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md:
  1. Orchestrator (lines 516-691):
     - Task dependency management
     - Worker spawning with descriptive names
     - MCP server for Primary Terminal
     - Thin wrapper around claude-flow commands

  2. Worker Management (lines 692-882):
     - Spawn claude-flow instances as workers
     - Each worker in separate tmux session
     - Passive output monitoring
     - Worker lifecycle (spawn/pause/resume/kill)

  3. Integration (lines 883-1064):
     - Use existing OrchFlow crates (orchflow-mux, orchflow-core)
     - WebSocket for real-time updates
     - State persistence and recovery

  The orchestrator must preserve claude-flow's coordination (thin wrapper principle)"

  Phase 4: Worker Access & Polish

  npx claude-flow@2.0.0-alpha.50 sparc run developer "Implement worker access and final integration.

  SPECIFICATIONS:
  1. Worker Access (lines 1928-2029 of TECHNICAL_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md):
     - Natural language: 'show me the React developer'
     - Numeric shortcuts: press 1-9
     - Interactive worker sessions
     - Return to primary terminal

  2. MCP Tools Registration:
     - orchflow_spawn_worker
     - orchflow_list_workers  
     - orchflow_connect_worker
     - orchflow_pause_worker

  3. Final Integration:
     - Connect all components
     - Ensure command flow: npm install -g @orchflow/claude-flow && claude-flow orchflow
     - Test natural language orchestration
     - Verify status pane updates

  Reference WORKER_TERMINAL_ACCESS_GUIDE.md for access patterns"

  Option 3: Focused Swarm with Key Files

  npx claude-flow@2.0.0-alpha.50 swarm "Build OrchFlow focusing on these key implementation files from 
  TECHNICAL_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md:

  ENTRY POINT (lines 1598-1650):
  - src/main.ts - Main orchestrator initialization

  NPM WRAPPER (ORCHFLOW_DISTRIBUTION_FINAL.md):
  - package.json
  - bin/claude-flow.js - Command interceptor
  - src/component-manager.ts - Binary downloader

  CORE COMPONENTS:
  - src/primary-terminal/orchflow-terminal.ts (lines 346-515)
  - src/orchestrator/orchflow-orchestrator.ts (lines 516-691)  
  - src/worker-terminal/orchflow-worker.ts (lines 692-882)
  - src/status-pane/status-pane.ts (lines 1840-1927)
  - src/worker-access/worker-access-manager.ts (lines 1928-2029)

  Start with the NPM wrapper, then build core components, finally integrate everything.
  The goal: claude-flow orchflow launches natural language orchestration" --max-agents 6 --strategy development

‚óè Update Todos
  ‚éø  ‚òí Verify line numbers in TECHNICAL_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md for accurate references
     ‚òí Create comprehensive claude-flow commands with correct references

‚óè üí° Recommendation

  Given the 2200-line guide, I recommend Option 2: Phased Implementation. It:
  - Breaks work into digestible chunks
  - Ensures each phase builds on the previous
  - Allows testing at each stage
  - References specific line numbers for accuracy

  Start with Phase 1 (NPM wrapper) since that's the foundation everything else depends on!










Option 1: Single Swarm Command (Recommended)

  npx claude-flow@2.0.0-alpha.50 swarm "Build the complete OrchFlow system as specified in 
  /workspaces/orchflow/demos/ai-orchestrator/TECHNICAL_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md

  Key requirements:
  1. Create NPM package @orchflow/claude-flow that wraps claude-flow
  2. Implement command interception (orchflow command launches OrchFlow, others pass through)
  3. Build component download system for Rust binaries
  4. Create 70/30 split terminal layout with status pane
  5. Register MCP tools for orchestrator control
  6. Implement worker spawning with descriptive names
  7. Build the TypeScript and Rust components as specified
  8. Follow the exact architecture in the guide
  9. Use the coding standards from ORCHFLOW_CODING_STANDARDS.md
  10. Test the complete flow: npm install -g @orchflow/claude-flow && claude-flow orchflow

  Reference these supporting docs as needed:
  - ORCHFLOW_DISTRIBUTION_FINAL.md for distribution strategy
  - ORCHFLOW_TERMINAL_SETUP.md for setup flow
  - VISIBILITY_DESIGN.md for status pane
  - WORKER_TERMINAL_ACCESS_GUIDE.md for worker access" --max-agents 8 --strategy development --monitor

  Option 2: Phased Sparc Approach

  If you prefer more control, run these in sequence:

  # Phase 1: NPM Wrapper
  npx claude-flow@2.0.0-alpha.50 sparc run architect "Design the @orchflow/claude-flow NPM package structure based on
   TECHNICAL_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md sections on distribution and command interception"

  npx claude-flow@2.0.0-alpha.50 sparc run developer "Implement the @orchflow/claude-flow NPM wrapper package with 
  command interception as specified in the TECHNICAL_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md"

  # Phase 2: Core Components  
  npx claude-flow@2.0.0-alpha.50 sparc run developer "Build the OrchFlow TypeScript components: Primary Terminal, 
  Status Pane, and MCP integration as specified in TECHNICAL_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md Component Implementation 
  section"

  npx claude-flow@2.0.0-alpha.50 sparc run developer "Implement the Rust components (orchflow-core, orchflow-mux) for
   orchestration and tmux integration per TECHNICAL_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md"

  # Phase 3: Integration & Testing
  npx claude-flow@2.0.0-alpha.50 sparc run tester "Create comprehensive tests for OrchFlow and verify the complete 
  user flow works: npm install -g @orchflow/claude-flow && claude-flow orchflow"

  Option 3: Hive-Mind for Maximum Autonomy

  npx claude-flow@2.0.0-alpha.50 hive-mind "You are the lead architect for building OrchFlow. Study the complete 
  technical implementation at /workspaces/orchflow/demos/ai-orchestrator/TECHNICAL_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md and 
  coordinate the full implementation.

  Create a working system where users can:
  1. Install via: npm install -g @orchflow/claude-flow
  2. Run: claude-flow orchflow
  3. Get natural language orchestration with live status monitoring

  You have full autonomy to:
  - Create the complete folder structure
  - Write all TypeScript and Rust code
  - Setup the build system
  - Create tests
  - Build and verify everything works

  The implementation guide has all technical details. Build it exactly as specified." --claude

  Why These Commands Work

  The TECHNICAL_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md contains:
  - ‚úÖ Complete code examples for every component
  - ‚úÖ Exact file structures and locations
  - ‚úÖ Integration patterns and APIs
  - ‚úÖ Testing strategies
  - ‚úÖ Distribution approach

  Claude-flow can read the guide and implement everything autonomously because it's essentially a detailed blueprint
  with working code samples.

  My recommendation: Use the single swarm command (Option 1) for the most autonomous build with progress monitoring.

‚óè Update Todos
  ‚éø  ‚òí Use claude-flow to build OrchFlow based on technical implementation guide
     ‚òí Determine minimal claude-flow commands for autonomous build

> should i execute that in my existing hive-mind session or create a new one, are there pluses or minuses ?

‚óè Great question! Here are the key considerations:

  üîÑ Existing Hive-Mind Session

  Pros:
  - ‚úÖ Already has context from the research/planning phase
  - ‚úÖ Understands the architecture decisions we made
  - ‚úÖ Can reference its own recommendations
  - ‚úÖ Maintains continuity of thought

  Cons:
  - ‚ùå May have accumulated context that could confuse implementation
  - ‚ùå Research mindset vs building mindset
  - ‚ùå Potentially hitting token limits with all the previous context

  üÜï New Session

  Pros:
  - ‚úÖ Fresh start focused purely on building
  - ‚úÖ Clean context window for implementation
  - ‚úÖ Can use swarm (better for building) instead of hive-mind
  - ‚úÖ More focused on execution rather than analysis

  Cons:
  - ‚ùå Loses the research context
  - ‚ùå Needs to re-read all documentation

  üí° My Recommendation: New Session with Swarm

  Start fresh with a swarm focused on building:

  npx claude-flow@2.0.0-alpha.50 swarm "Build the complete OrchFlow system as specified in 
  /workspaces/orchflow/demos/ai-orchestrator/TECHNICAL_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md

  Context: We've completed all research and planning. The implementation guide contains the exact blueprint. Your job
   is purely execution - build exactly what's specified.

  Key requirements:
  1. Create NPM package @orchflow/claude-flow that wraps claude-flow
  2. Implement command interception (orchflow command launches OrchFlow, others pass through)
  3. Build component download system for Rust binaries
  4. Create 70/30 split terminal layout with status pane
  5. Register MCP tools for orchestrator control
  6. Implement worker spawning with descriptive names
  7. Build the TypeScript and Rust components as specified
  8. Follow the exact architecture in the guide
  9. Use the coding standards from ORCHFLOW_CODING_STANDARDS.md
  10. Test the complete flow: npm install -g @orchflow/claude-flow && claude-flow orchflow

  Start by creating the project structure and NPM package setup." --max-agents 8 --strategy development --monitor

  Why swarm over hive-mind for building:
  - Swarm is better for focused development tasks
  - Multiple specialized agents (architect, developer, tester)
  - Better parallelization of implementation work
  - More action-oriented vs research-oriented

  The clean slate approach ensures the agents focus solely on building what's documented rather than revisiting
  decisions!

> does it matter if its 2200 lines long the guide?

‚óè Good point! 2200 lines might be challenging. Here's how to handle it:

  üìä Token Considerations

  Potential Issues with 2200 lines:
  - May exceed initial context window
  - Could cause agents to miss important details
  - Might slow down processing

  üéØ Better Approach: Chunked Implementation

  Break it into focused phases:

  Phase 1: NPM Wrapper (Most Critical)

  npx claude-flow@2.0.0-alpha.50 swarm "Build the NPM wrapper package for OrchFlow.

  Read these sections from /workspaces/orchflow/demos/ai-orchestrator/TECHNICAL_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md:
  - 'Component Implementation' ‚Üí 'Complete Implementation Example' (lines 1600-1650)
  - 'Code Examples' section for NPM structure
  - Distribution approach from ORCHFLOW_DISTRIBUTION_FINAL.md

  Create @orchflow/claude-flow package that:
  1. Intercepts 'claude-flow orchflow' command
  2. Passes through all other commands to real claude-flow
  3. Downloads Rust binaries on first use
  4. Has proper package.json structure

  Start with just the wrapper - we'll add features incrementally." --max-agents 4 --strategy development

  Phase 2: Core Components

  npx claude-flow@2.0.0-alpha.50 swarm "Build OrchFlow's core components.

  The NPM wrapper exists. Now implement:
  1. Primary Terminal with MCP integration (see lines 349-515 of TECHNICAL_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md)
  2. Status Pane (lines 1843-1927)
  3. Basic orchestrator (lines 519-690)

  Focus on getting basic terminal split working with status display." --max-agents 4

  Phase 3: Worker Management

  npx claude-flow@2.0.0-alpha.50 swarm "Implement OrchFlow worker management.

  Add worker spawning and management:
  1. Worker implementation (lines 697-882)
  2. Worker access manager (lines 1932-2029)
  3. Integration with claude-flow commands

  Reference WORKER_TERMINAL_ACCESS_GUIDE.md for access patterns." --max-agents 4

  üöÄ Alternative: Reference-Based Approach

  Instead of reading the entire guide, point to specific sections:

  npx claude-flow@2.0.0-alpha.50 sparc run developer "Build OrchFlow's NPM wrapper package.

  Key files to create:
  1. package.json - See ORCHFLOW_DISTRIBUTION_FINAL.md for exact structure
  2. bin/claude-flow.js - Command interceptor (TECHNICAL_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md line 1608)
  3. src/orchflow.ts - Main entry point
  4. src/component-manager.ts - Binary downloader

  The wrapper should intercept 'orchflow' command only. Test with: npm link && claude-flow orchflow"

  üí° Best Strategy: Start Small

  Begin with the simplest working version:
  1. NPM wrapper that intercepts commands ‚úì
  2. Basic "Hello from OrchFlow" response ‚úì
  3. Then incrementally add features ‚úì

  This avoids overwhelming the agents and ensures you get a working foundation first!
