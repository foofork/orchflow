# OrchFlow Project Phases & Deliverables

## Project Overview

OrchFlow transforms claude-flow into a natural language orchestration system where users interact conversationally with Claude while complex work is distributed to worker terminals.

**End Goal**: Users run `npx claude-flow orchflow` and get a natural language terminal interface with live status monitoring.

## Phase 1: Smart NPM Wrapper Foundation (Weeks 1-2)

### What Gets Built:
1. **NPM Package: `@orchflow/claude-flow`**
   ```json
   {
     "name": "@orchflow/claude-flow",
     "bin": {
       "claude-flow": "./bin/claude-flow.js"
     },
     "dependencies": {
       "claude-flow": "^2.0.0-alpha.50"
     }
   }
   ```

2. **Command Interceptor**
   - Intercepts `claude-flow orchflow` command
   - Passes through all other claude-flow commands unchanged
   - Zero interference with existing claude-flow usage

3. **Component Manager**
   - Downloads Rust binaries on first use
   - Verifies checksums for security
   - Caches in `~/.orchflow/components/`
   - Platform detection (Linux/macOS/Windows)

### Deliverables:
- Working npm package that wraps claude-flow
- Automatic component download system
- Cross-platform binary management

## Phase 2: Terminal Interface & Layout (Weeks 3-4)

### What Gets Built:
1. **70/30 Split Screen Layout**
   ```
   ┌─────────────────────┬─────────────────────────┐
   │ Primary Terminal    │ Live Status Pane        │
   │ (70% width)         │ (30% width)             │
   │ Claude conversation │ Worker status & progress│
   └─────────────────────┴─────────────────────────┘
   ```

2. **Primary Terminal Interface**
   - Natural language conversation with Claude
   - MCP tool integration for orchestrator control
   - Never blocked by long-running tasks
   - Context-aware responses

3. **Status Pane**
   - Real-time worker monitoring
   - Descriptive worker names ("JWT Auth Builder")
   - Progress bars and status indicators
   - Quick access keys (1-9)
   - Resource usage display

4. **Environment Detection**
   - Auto-detect tmux availability
   - VS Code terminal integration
   - Fallback to inline status mode
   - User preference storage

### Deliverables:
- Split-screen terminal layout

1. **Rust Orchestrator Backend**
   - Task dependency analysis
   - Intelligent work scheduling
   - Conflict detection
   - Resource management
   - Worker lifecycle control

2. **Worker Management**
   - Spawn claude-flow instances as workers

3. **Claude-Flow Integration**
   - Thin wrapper preserving claude-flow behavior
   - Command generation for different worker types
   - Output stream parsing
   - Progress extraction

4. **State Management**

   - Worker state tracking
   - Session recovery
   - Crash resilience

### Deliverables:
- Working orchestrator that spawns/manages workers

   - Worker management through chat

2. **Worker Access System**
   - Connect to workers by name: "Show me the JWT builder"
   - Numeric shortcuts: Press 1-9
   - Interactive worker sessions
   - Return to primary terminal
   - Worker history viewing

3. **Smart Features**
   - Worker name generation from task context
   - Automatic conflict resolution
   - Dependency detection
   - Parallel vs sequential execution

### Deliverables:
- Natural language interface
- Seamless worker access
- Context-aware orchestration
- Smart scheduling

## Phase 5: Production Polish (Weeks 9-10)
