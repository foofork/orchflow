## Current Focus: Phase 6 - Frontend Integration & Polish (2-3 weeks) 🔵

### 6.0 Wire Up Missing Commands (Immediate Priority)
- [ ] Add `select_backend_pane` command - Wrap existing MuxBackend method
- [ ] Add `list_plugins` command - Expose plugin registry listing
- [ ] Add `get_plugin_metadata` command - Get plugin info for UI
- [ ] Add `persist_state` command - Manual state save trigger
- [ ] Fix LoadPlugin/UnloadPlugin implementation - Currently returns "not_implemented"

### 6.1 Frontend Migration (High Priority)
- [ ] Update frontend to use new orchestrator API
- [ ] Create plugin UI components (depends on plugin commands work completed)
- [ ] Implement plugin marketplace UI (browsing only)
- [ ] Test end-to-end functionality

### 6.2 Performance Optimization (High Priority)
- [ ] Achieve startup time <100ms (currently ~150ms)
- [ ] Reduce memory usage <100MB base
- [ ] Optimize WebSocket communication
- [ ] Implement lazy loading for all components

### 6.3 Testing & Documentation (High Priority)
- [ ] Complete test coverage >85% for all components
- [ ] Document all APIs and protocols
- [ ] Create developer guides
- [ ] Build example projects

## Technical Debt Items 🔧

### High Priority
1. **Error Types**: Complete migration from String errors to typed errors
2. **Test Coverage**: Add comprehensive integration tests for new features
3. **Performance Monitoring**: Add metrics collection and dashboards

### Medium Priority
1. **Documentation**: Update architecture docs to reflect current state
2. **Code Organization**: Refactor module structure for better maintainability
3. **Build Process**: Optimize binary size (<50MB target)

### Low Priority
1. **Legacy Cleanup**: Remove backward compatibility code after migration
2. **Logging**: Standardize logging across all components
3. **Configuration**: Unified config system for all features

## Future Enhancements 📅

> **Important**: For detailed Manager + Orchestrator integration plans, see [MANAGER_ORCHESTRATOR_INTEGRATION_ROADMAP.md](./MANAGER_ORCHESTRATOR_INTEGRATION_ROADMAP.md)
