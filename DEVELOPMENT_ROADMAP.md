# Orchflow Development Roadmap

## üìã Roadmap Maintenance

**When to Update:**
- Task status changes
- New blockers emerge
- Priorities shift
- Features complete

**How to Update:**
1. Update "Current Development Focus" first
2. Move completed work to "Completed Phases"
3. Keep metrics current (performance, coverage)
4. Link relevant documentation
5. **FINISH THE JOB**: No task complete without passing tests

**TDD Requirement:**
- **MANDATORY**: Write tests FIRST, then code
- **Red ‚Üí Green ‚Üí Refactor**: Follow TDD cycle
- **>90% Coverage**: Maintain test coverage
- **See**: [Test Strategy Guide](docs/TEST_STRATEGY.md)

**Documentation Discipline:**
- **Roadmap Items** ‚Üí HERE, not scattered in code comments
- **Architecture Decisions** ‚Üí docs/architecture/UNIFIED_ARCHITECTURE.md
- **API Changes** ‚Üí Relevant API docs
- **NO SPRAWL**: Don't document roadmap items in random files

## üéâ Major Milestone: Phase 5 Complete!

### üö® CRITICAL: Test-Driven Development is MANDATORY

**FINISH THE JOB** - No feature is complete without:
1. **Tests Written FIRST** - TDD is not optional
2. **All Tests PASSING** - Red ‚Üí Green ‚Üí Refactor
3. **Coverage >90%** - Measure and maintain
4. **CI/CD Green** - No merging with failing tests

> **üìñ See [Test Strategy Guide](docs/TEST_STRATEGY.md) for testing approach**
> **üìñ See [Contributing Guide](docs/CONTRIBUTING.md) for TDD workflow**

### Executive Summary
Orchflow has successfully completed **all infrastructure and core implementation phases** (Phases 1-5), establishing a production-ready foundation with:

> **üìñ For complete system architecture, see [Unified Architecture Design](docs/architecture/UNIFIED_ARCHITECTURE.md)**
> **üìñ For component responsibilities, see [Component Architecture Guide](docs/COMPONENT_RESPONSIBILITIES.md)**
- ‚úÖ **MuxBackend abstraction** - Clean separation of terminal multiplexer operations
- ‚úÖ **Unified state management** - Single source of truth with StateManager
- ‚úÖ **Comprehensive error handling** - 12 error categories with rich context
- ‚úÖ **Enhanced terminal management** - Multi-shell support, command history, output search
- ‚úÖ **Complete file management** - File operations, watching, project-wide search
- ‚úÖ **Editor integration** - Monaco removed, CodeMirror + Neovim fully operational
- ‚úÖ **Muxd backend** - High-performance multiplexer daemon with WebSocket transport
- ‚úÖ **Plugin ecosystem** - Complete plugin system with production examples

**Current Status**: Phase 7 Complete! Core UI implemented. Working on remaining features and polish.

## üéâ UPDATE: All Tests Passing! (January 2025)

**Major Discovery**: Hive Mind analysis revealed the test suite is fully functional:
- ‚úÖ **139/139 tests PASSING** (not 51 failing as previously reported)
- ‚úÖ **No blockers** for feature development
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Test coverage at 24.07%** - needs improvement to >90%
- üöÄ **Development unblocked** - can proceed with features using TDD

This changes our immediate priorities from fixing tests to improving coverage!

## üöß Recent Development Work (January 2025)

**Test Infrastructure Improvements:**
- ‚úÖ Fixed 21 compilation errors in Tauri backend tests (reduced from 132 to 111)
- ‚úÖ Fixed CreatePane struct field mismatches
- ‚úÖ Fixed CreateSession Default trait usage
- ‚úÖ Added comprehensive unit tests for Rust Terminal Manager (muxd):
  - PTY tests (8 tests covering creation, spawning, I/O, resize, kill)
  - Pane tests (10 tests covering lifecycle, I/O, resize, working directory)
  - SessionManager tests (11 tests covering session/pane management, limits, concurrency)
  - Integration tests for end-to-end scenarios

**Known Issues to Address:**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **TerminalStreamManager testability** - Currently requires tauri::AppHandle, making unit tests impossible
  - TODO: Refactor to use dependency injection for IPC communication
  - TODO: Create trait-based abstraction for Tauri-specific functionality
  - TODO: Move integration tests requiring Tauri runtime to separate test suite
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **111 remaining compilation errors** in Tauri backend tests
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Missing terminal_stream exports** in various test files
