# Orchflow Development Roadmap

## 📋 Roadmap Maintenance

**When to Update:**
- Task status changes
- New blockers emerge
- Priorities shift
- Features complete

**How to Update:**
1. Update "Current Development Focus" first
2. Move completed work to "Completed Phases"
3. Keep metrics current (performance, coverage)
4. Link relevant documentation
5. **FINISH THE JOB**: No task complete without passing tests

**TDD Requirement:**
- **MANDATORY**: Write tests FIRST, then code
- **Red → Green → Refactor**: Follow TDD cycle
- **>90% Coverage**: Maintain test coverage
- **See**: [Test Strategy Guide](docs/TEST_STRATEGY.md)

**Documentation Discipline:**
- **Roadmap Items** → HERE, not scattered in code comments
- **Architecture Decisions** → docs/architecture/UNIFIED_ARCHITECTURE.md
- **API Changes** → Relevant API docs
- **NO SPRAWL**: Don't document roadmap items in random files

## 🎉 Major Milestone: Phase 5 Complete!

### 🚨 CRITICAL: Test-Driven Development is MANDATORY

**FINISH THE JOB** - No feature is complete without:
1. **Tests Written FIRST** - TDD is not optional
2. **All Tests PASSING** - Red → Green → Refactor
3. **Coverage >90%** - Measure and maintain
4. **CI/CD Green** - No merging with failing tests

> **📖 See [Test Strategy Guide](docs/TEST_STRATEGY.md) for testing approach**
> **📖 See [Contributing Guide](docs/CONTRIBUTING.md) for TDD workflow**

### Executive Summary
Orchflow has successfully completed **all infrastructure and core implementation phases** (Phases 1-5), establishing a production-ready foundation with:

| Test Coverage | ✅ | 84% pass rate (528/627 tests), major components tested |
| Git Integration | ❌ | Complete panel UI, operations |
| Plugin System | ❌ | WASM/native loading |
| Frontend API | ⚠️ | StatusBar, CommandBar using old orchestrator |
| Component Enhancement | ❌ | Missing Dialog, ContextMenu features |

### Medium Priority
- Terminal scrollback search
- Search result syntax highlighting  
- Real file permissions (not hardcoded)

### Low Priority
- Remove legacy AppState
- Update architecture docs

## Current Development Focus 🚧

### ⚠️ TDD Requirements for Active Work
**EVERY feature below MUST follow TDD:**
1. Write failing tests FIRST
2. Implement minimal code to pass
3. Refactor with confidence
4. Document test scenarios

### 🎯 STRATEGIC PRIORITY: Complete the Rust Manager First

#### 🚨 KEY ARCHITECTURAL DECISION: ruv-FANN Integration Mode
**STATUS**: Decision needed before Terminal Metadata System implementation
- **Feature Flag Approach**: Use ruv-FANN as toggle between IPC vs direct integration
- **Performance Impact**: Direct mode eliminates sidecar process overhead
- **Affects**: Terminal metadata design, agent coordination, process architecture
- **Documentation**: Updated in [Unified Architecture](docs/architecture/UNIFIED_ARCHITECTURE.md)
- **Timeline**: Decision required by Week 4 (Terminal Metadata System phase)

#### Phase 1.0: Test Coverage & Feature Completion (IN PROGRESS) ⚡ CRITICAL

**🏆 Progress Summary**: Major test infrastructure complete with 282+ documented tests across frontend and backend. Key components (Terminal, GitPanel, NeovimEditor, FileManager) have comprehensive test suites. The Phase 8 sprint added 627 total tests with 84% pass rate. Focus now shifts to increasing overall coverage to >90% and fixing remaining test failures.
