## Technical Debt Items 🔧

### Completed ✅
1. **Error Types**: ✅ Complete migration from String errors to typed errors
2. **Test Coverage**: ✅ Add comprehensive integration tests for new features
3. **Performance Monitoring**: ✅ Add metrics collection and dashboards
4. **SQLx to SimpleStateStore Migration**: ✅ Migrated test_results_v2.rs implementation
5. **Module Commands**: ✅ Implement module commands through ModuleSystem
6. **File Operations**: ✅ Add trash functionality with metadata tracking
7. **Search & Replace**: ✅ Implement project-wide search and replace
8. **CI/CD Pipeline**: ✅ GitHub Actions for testing, quality, and releases

### High Priority (Remaining)
1. **Git Integration**: Complete git panel UI and advanced git operations
2. **Plugin System**: Complete WASM/native loading and activation events
3. **Testing**: Fix remaining test failures and improve test coverage
4. **Component Enhancement**: Add missing functionality identified in component analysis
5. **Frontend API Consolidation**: Complete migration from orchestrator to manager API

#### Frontend API Consolidation (Technical Debt)
**Status**: Partially complete - some components still use old orchestrator store  
**Issue**: Mixed API usage creates maintenance burden and inconsistent behavior

**Remaining Components to Migrate**:
- [ ] **StatusBar.svelte** - Still imports from `orchestrator` store
- [ ] **CommandBar.svelte** - Still uses `orchestrator.createTerminal()`, `orchestrator.execute()`
- [ ] **Component Audit** - Review all components for mixed API usage patterns

**Migration Pattern**:
```typescript
// Old: orchestrator store (legacy)
import { orchestrator } from '$lib/stores/orchestrator';
await orchestrator.createTerminal(sessionId, options);

// New: manager store (current)
import { manager } from '$lib/stores/manager';
await manager.createTerminal(sessionId, options);
```

**Benefits**: Unified API, better performance, full type safety, consistent error handling  
**Timeline**: 1-2 weeks to complete remaining components  
**Priority**: High - reduces maintenance burden and API confusion

### Medium Priority (Remaining)
1. **Terminal Features**: Implement scrollback search and process tracking
2. **Search Enhancements**: Add syntax highlighting and context to results
3. **File Permissions**: Get actual file permissions instead of hardcoded values

### Low Priority (Remaining)

2. **Test Improvements**: Fix unit test Tauri app handle issues
3. **Documentation**: Update architecture docs to reflect current state
