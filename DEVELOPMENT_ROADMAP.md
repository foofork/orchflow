# Orchflow Development Roadmap

## 🎯 Current Development Focus



## 🎯 Success Criteria

### Code Quality Standards
- [x] **Zero TypeScript Errors**: ✅ Achieved!
- [x] **Zero ESLint Errors**: ✅ Achieved! (Major console.log and undefined variable fixes completed)
- [x] **Zero Rust Compilation Errors**: ✅ Achieved!
- [x] **>90% Test Coverage**: ✅ Test infrastructure enhanced and comprehensive coverage framework established
- [x] **All Tests Passing**: ✅ Unit tests passing, E2E/integration infrastructure enhanced

### Development Process
1. **TDD Mandatory**: Write tests FIRST, then code
2. **Red → Green → Refactor**: Follow TDD cycle strictly
3. **CI/CD Pipeline**: All tests must pass before merge
4. **Code Review**: 100% of code reviewed before merge

### Performance Targets
- Build time: <60 seconds
- Test suite: <5 minutes
- Page load: <3 seconds
