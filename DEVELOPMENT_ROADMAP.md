## Current Development Focus 🚧

### 🎉 PHASE 1 COMPLETE - READY FOR PHASE 2

**Phase 1 Status**: ✅ **COMPLETE** (July 10, 2025)
- **Test Coverage**: 627 tests with 84% pass rate achieved
- **Build System**: Tauri 2.0 migration complete, frontend builds successfully
- **Major Components**: Comprehensive test suites for all core components
- **Backend Systems**: File manager, search, module system, terminal management functional

**Next Priority**: Phase 2 - Terminal Intelligence & Production

### ⚠️ TDD Requirements for Phase 2 Work
**EVERY feature below MUST follow TDD:**
1. Write failing tests FIRST
2. Implement minimal code to pass
3. Refactor with confidence
4. Document test scenarios

### 🎯 STRATEGIC PRIORITY: Phase 2 - Terminal Intelligence & Production

#### 🚨 KEY ARCHITECTURAL DECISION: ruv-FANN Integration Mode
**STATUS**: Decision needed before Terminal Metadata System implementation
- **Feature Flag Approach**: Use ruv-FANN as toggle between IPC vs direct integration
- **Performance Impact**: Direct mode eliminates sidecar process overhead
- **Multi-Project Support**: Architecture must support multiple projects/workspaces simultaneously
  - IPC approach: Natural process isolation per project
  - Direct integration: Requires namespace/context isolation design
  - Decision affects scalability and resource management
- **Affects**: Terminal metadata design, agent coordination, process architecture, multi-project support
- **Documentation**: Updated in [Unified Architecture](docs/architecture/UNIFIED_ARCHITECTURE.md)
- **Timeline**: Decision required by Week 4 (Terminal Metadata System phase)

#### Phase 2: Terminal Intelligence & Production (Weeks 4-6)

**Terminal Metadata System & Orchestrator Architecture** (Week 4-5) - AI Foundation
- [ ] **🚨 CRITICAL DECISION NEEDED**: ruv-FANN Integration Architecture
  - **Decision**: Use ruv-FANN as feature flag to replace IPC with direct integration
  - **Impact**: Eliminates orchestrator sidecar process overhead when enabled
  - **Multi-Project Considerations**:
    - MUST support multiple projects/workspaces simultaneously
    - IPC mode: Natural isolation via separate processes per project
    - Direct mode: Requires explicit namespace/context isolation
    - Affects resource pooling and orchestrator lifecycle management
  - **Options**: 
    - OFF: Legacy IPC mode (JSON-RPC over stdio/socket) - stable fallback, easier multi-project
    - ON: Direct integration mode (embedded in Rust process) - performance optimized, complex multi-project
  - **Rationale**: Single process model improves performance, simplifies deployment, eliminates IPC failure modes
  - **Implementation**: Factory pattern with OrchestratorConfig.ruvFANNMode feature flag
  - **See**: [Unified Architecture docs/architecture/UNIFIED_ARCHITECTURE.md] for complete design
- [ ] Research terminal classification patterns (dependent on orchestrator decision)
- [ ] Terminal type classification (Build, Test, REPL, Debug, Agent)

- [ ] Purpose-driven terminal management
- [ ] Context tracking per terminal
- [ ] Process lifecycle monitoring
- [ ] Error pattern detection
- [ ] Command intent detection preparation

**Terminal Security Framework** (Week 5) - 🔐 DECISION NEEDED
- [ ] **DECISION REQUIRED**: Choose security implementation approach
