# Orchflow Development Roadmap

## 📋 Roadmap Maintenance

**When to Update:**
- Task status changes
- New blockers emerge
- Priorities shift
- Features complete

**How to Update:**
1. Update "Current Development Focus" first
2. Move completed work to "Completed Phases"
3. Keep metrics current (performance, coverage)
4. Link relevant documentation
5. **FINISH THE JOB**: No task complete without passing tests

**TDD Requirement:**
- **MANDATORY**: Write tests FIRST, then code
- **Red → Green → Refactor**: Follow TDD cycle
- **>90% Coverage**: Maintain test coverage
- **See**: [Test Strategy Guide](docs/TEST_STRATEGY.md)

**Documentation Discipline:**
- **Roadmap Items** → HERE, not scattered in code comments
- **Architecture Decisions** → docs/architecture/UNIFIED_ARCHITECTURE.md
- **API Changes** → Relevant API docs
- **NO SPRAWL**: Don't document roadmap items in random files

## 🎉 Major Milestone: Phase 5 Complete!

### 🚨 CRITICAL: Test-Driven Development is MANDATORY

**FINISH THE JOB** - No feature is complete without:
1. **Tests Written FIRST** - TDD is not optional
2. **All Tests PASSING** - Red → Green → Refactor
3. **Coverage >90%** - Measure and maintain
4. **CI/CD Green** - No merging with failing tests

## Technical Debt Items 🔧

### Completed ✅
1. **Error Types**: ✅ Complete migration from String errors to typed errors
2. **Test Coverage**: ✅ Add comprehensive integration tests for new features
3. **Performance Monitoring**: ✅ Add metrics collection and dashboards
4. **SQLx to SimpleStateStore Migration**: ✅ Migrated test_results_v2.rs implementation
5. **Module Commands**: ✅ Implement module commands through ModuleSystem
6. **File Operations**: ✅ Add trash functionality with metadata tracking
7. **Search & Replace**: ✅ Implement project-wide search and replace
8. **CI/CD Pipeline**: ✅ GitHub Actions for testing, quality, and releases

### High Priority (Remaining)
1. **Git Integration**: Complete git panel UI and advanced git operations
2. **Plugin System**: Complete WASM/native loading and activation events
3. **Testing**: Fix remaining test failures and improve test coverage
4. **Component Enhancement**: Add missing functionality identified in component analysis
5. **Frontend API Consolidation**: Complete migration from orchestrator to manager API

#### Frontend API Consolidation (Technical Debt)
**Status**: Partially complete - some components still use old orchestrator store  
**Issue**: Mixed API usage creates maintenance burden and inconsistent behavior

**Remaining Components to Migrate**:
- [ ] **StatusBar.svelte** - Still imports from `orchestrator` store
- [ ] **CommandBar.svelte** - Still uses `orchestrator.createTerminal()`, `orchestrator.execute()`
- [ ] **Component Audit** - Review all components for mixed API usage patterns

**Migration Pattern**:
```typescript
// Old: orchestrator store (legacy)
import { orchestrator } from '$lib/stores/orchestrator';
await orchestrator.createTerminal(sessionId, options);

// New: manager store (current)
import { manager } from '$lib/stores/manager';
await manager.createTerminal(sessionId, options);
```

**Benefits**: Unified API, better performance, full type safety, consistent error handling  
**Timeline**: 1-2 weeks to complete remaining components  
**Priority**: High - reduces maintenance burden and API confusion

### Medium Priority (Remaining)
1. **Terminal Features**: Implement scrollback search and process tracking
2. **Search Enhancements**: Add syntax highlighting and context to results
3. **File Permissions**: Get actual file permissions instead of hardcoded values

### Low Priority (Remaining)
1. **Legacy Cleanup**: Remove AppState after full migration
2. **Test Improvements**: Fix unit test Tauri app handle issues
3. **Documentation**: Update architecture docs to reflect current state

## Current Development Focus 🚧

   - **Impact**: Security vulnerabilities, data loss
   - **Mitigation**:
     - Sandboxed execution environment
     - Permission manifest system
     - Code signing for plugins
     - Resource usage limits

5. **Integration Complexity**
   - **Risk**: Manager ↔ Orchestrator protocol issues
   - **Impact**: AI features may not work reliably
   - **Mitigation**:
     - Mock implementations first
     - Comprehensive protocol tests
     - Version negotiation support
     - Graceful degradation

### Resource Risks

1. **Timeline Pressure**
   - **Risk**: Rushing to add AI features before core is stable

     - Clear phase boundaries

3. **Documentation Drift**
   - **Risk**: Docs becoming outdated as code evolves
   - **Impact**: Confusion, wasted time, poor onboarding
   - **Mitigation**:
     - Docs updates required in PRs
     - Regular doc audits
     - Auto-generated API docs

### Strategic Risks

1. **Market Timing**
   - **Risk**: Competitors releasing AI IDEs first
   - **Impact**: Loss of first-mover advantage
   - **Mitigation**:
     - Focus on quality over speed
     - Unique terminal-first approach
     - Strong community building

2. **Technology Choices**
