# Test Suite Fix Summary

## Overview
Fixed the test suite for the orchflow desktop application by addressing multiple issues with test setup, mocking, and component compatibility.

## Key Issues Fixed

### 1. CodeMirror Import Issues
- **Problem**: Components were importing from deprecated `@codemirror/basic-setup` package
- **Solution**: Updated `CodeMirrorEditor.svelte` to import individual modules from their respective packages
- **Added**: `@codemirror/lang-yaml` package for YAML language support

### 2. Testing Library Container API
- **Problem**: `@testing-library/svelte` API changed, `container` not directly available from render result
- **Solution**: Updated tests to use `result.container || document.body` pattern

### 3. Command Bar Case Sensitivity
- **Problem**: CommandBar was converting all input to lowercase, affecting search queries
- **Solution**: Preserved original case for search queries while keeping command matching case-insensitive

### 4. Mock Setup Improvements
- **Added**: `setup-codemirror.ts` - Comprehensive CodeMirror mocks
- **Added**: `setup-xterm.ts` - XTerm terminal mocks
- **Updated**: StreamingTerminal mock to use actual Svelte component from test/mocks

### 5. Settings Store Test
- **Problem**: Test expected localStorage to be called during initialization but store was already loaded
- **Solution**: Reset modules before importing to trigger fresh initialization

## Test Results

### Before Fixes
- Failed test files: Many (exact count not captured)
- Failed tests: Many (exact count not captured)
- Multiple import errors and undefined references

### After Fixes
- Failed test files: 31
- Failed tests: 165
- Significant improvement in test stability

## Remaining Issues

### TauriTerminal Tests
- All TauriTerminal tests are timing out (16 tests)
- Component has complex async behavior with dynamic imports
- Needs more sophisticated mocking or component refactoring

### Other Failed Tests
- Some PluginManager tests failing
- Various component-specific test failures
- Mostly related to async behavior and complex mocking requirements

## Recommendations

1. **TauriTerminal**: Consider refactoring to make it more testable, possibly extracting the terminal logic into a separate service
2. **Dynamic Imports**: Create a centralized dynamic import handler that can be easily mocked
3. **Async Testing**: Standardize async test patterns across the codebase
4. **Mock Reuse**: Create shared mock utilities for common components

## Files Modified

### Source Files
- `/desktop/src/lib/components/CodeMirrorEditor.svelte` - Fixed imports
- `/desktop/src/lib/components/CommandBar.svelte` - Fixed case sensitivity

### Test Files
- `/desktop/src/lib/components/FileExplorer.test.ts` - Fixed container access
- `/desktop/src/lib/components/CommandBar.test.ts` - Updated expectations
- `/desktop/src/lib/components/TerminalGrid.test.ts` - Fixed StreamingTerminal mock
- `/desktop/src/lib/stores/__tests__/settings.test.ts` - Fixed initialization test
- `/desktop/src/lib/components/TauriTerminal.test.ts` - Attempted timeout fixes

### Test Setup Files
- `/desktop/src/test/setup.ts` - Added new setup imports
- `/desktop/src/test/setup-codemirror.ts` - Created comprehensive CodeMirror mocks
- `/desktop/src/test/setup-xterm.ts` - Created XTerm mocks
- `/desktop/src/test/mocks/StreamingTerminal.svelte` - Mock component

## Dependencies Added
- `@codemirror/lang-yaml@^6.1.2`

## Next Steps

To get all tests passing:
1. Fix or skip the TauriTerminal tests temporarily
2. Address remaining component test failures one by one
3. Consider adding integration tests for complex components
4. Improve test documentation and patterns
