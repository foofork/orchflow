# Desktop Test Suite Analysis Report

## Executive Summary

This report provides a comprehensive analysis of the failing unit tests in the desktop application, identifying root causes and patterns across the test suite.

## Test Configuration

- **Framework**: Vitest
- **Environment**: jsdom
- **Timeout Settings**: 30s (standardized across test and hook timeouts)
- **Retry Policy**: 1 retry for failed tests
- **Setup Files**: Comprehensive mocking for Tauri APIs, browser APIs, and third-party libraries

## Critical Issues Identified

### 1. TypeScript Compilation Errors

#### Pattern: Missing `invoke` Property
```typescript
Error: Property 'invoke' does not exist on type 'typeof import("@tauri-apps/api/index")'
```
**Affected Files**:
- `/src/test/utils.ts` (lines 132-139)
- Multiple test files attempting to access `tauriApi.invoke`

**Root Cause**: The mock implementation expects `invoke` on the wrong import path. The `invoke` function is exported from `@tauri-apps/api/core`, not `@tauri-apps/api`.

#### Pattern: `mockSvelteEvents` Type Errors
```typescript
Error: This expression is not callable. Type 'never' has no call signatures.
```
**Affected Files**:
- `ActivityBar.test.ts` (multiple instances)
- Other component tests using `mockSvelteEvents`

**Root Cause**: The return type of `mockSvelteEvents` is incorrectly inferred as `never` in certain cases where the component parameter is undefined or has incorrect typing.

### 2. CodeMirror Integration Failures

#### Error Pattern
```
Failed to load CodeMirror: TypeError: languageCompartment.of is not a function
```
**Affected Tests**:
- All CodeMirrorEditor component tests

**Root Cause**: The CodeMirror mocking in `/src/test/setup-codemirror.ts` doesn't properly mock the compartment system, causing initialization failures.

### 3. Tauri API Integration Test Failures

#### Test: File System Integration
```
expected "spy" to be called with arguments: [ '/test/sample.txt', Any<Uint8Array> ]
```
**Issue**: The test expects `Any<Uint8Array>` but receives an actual Uint8Array instance.

#### Test: Cross-Component Integration
```
expected '' to contain 'Executing'
```
**Issue**: The terminal output isn't being captured properly in the integration test environment.

### 4. Timeout Configuration Issues

While timeouts are set to 30s, several patterns indicate potential race conditions:
- Tests using manual `setTimeout` delays
- Tests with custom timeout parameters in `waitFor` calls
- Inconsistent async handling in component lifecycle tests

### 5. Port Allocation System

**Port Ranges Configured**:
- dev: 5173-5180
- test: 5181-5190
- e2e: 5191-5200
- visual: 5201-5210

**Potential Issues**:
- Port lock file (`/.port-locks.json`) may contain stale entries
- No automatic cleanup on test interruption
- Possible conflicts when running parallel test suites

## Mock Infrastructure Analysis

### Strengths
1. Comprehensive Tauri API mocking coverage
2. Browser API mocks (ResizeObserver, IntersectionObserver, canvas)
3. XTerm terminal emulation mocks
4. Structured mock factory patterns

### Weaknesses
1. Svelte 5 event system compatibility issues
2. Incomplete CodeMirror extension mocking
3. Type safety issues with dynamic imports
4. Inconsistent mock return types

## Common Error Patterns

1. **Import Resolution**: Dynamic imports for Svelte components not properly typed
2. **Event Handling**: Svelte 5 migration causing event handler compatibility issues
3. **Async Operations**: Race conditions in tests with multiple async operations
4. **Mock Consistency**: Different mocking approaches causing type mismatches

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. Fix TypeScript compilation errors by correcting import paths for Tauri `invoke`
2. Update `mockSvelteEvents` to handle undefined components gracefully
3. Enhance CodeMirror mocking to include compartment system
4. Standardize test assertion patterns for Tauri API calls

### Medium-term Improvements
1. Migrate to Svelte 5 event patterns completely
2. Implement proper TypeScript types for all mock factories
3. Create integration test utilities for common patterns
4. Add pre-test port cleanup mechanism

### Long-term Strategy
1. Consider moving to Playwright component testing for better Svelte 5 support
2. Implement test categorization (unit/integration/e2e) with appropriate configurations
3. Create test fixture system for common test scenarios
4. Add continuous monitoring for test flakiness

## Test Coverage Gaps

Based on the analysis, the following areas lack proper test coverage:
1. Error boundary behaviors
2. WebSocket connection handling
3. File watcher integration
4. Multi-window coordination
5. Performance-critical paths

## Conclusion

The test suite has a solid foundation but requires targeted fixes to address TypeScript compilation errors, mock compatibility issues, and Svelte 5 migration challenges. Implementing the recommended actions will significantly improve test reliability and developer experience.
