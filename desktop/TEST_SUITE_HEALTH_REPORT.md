### Test Category Breakdown
| Category | Pass Rate | Status | Notes |
|----------|-----------|--------|-------|
| Unit Tests | 77.3% | ⚠️ Improving | Core functionality tests |
| Integration Tests | 25% | ❌ Critical | Cross-component tests failing |
| E2E Tests | 0% | ❌ Blocked | Infrastructure fixed, needs dev server |
| Performance Tests | 91.7% | ✅ Good | 11/12 passing |

## Issues Fixed

### 1. CodeMirror Test Failures ✅
- **Issue**: `languageCompartment.of is not a function`
- **Root Cause**: Compartment was mocked as a function instead of a class
- **Fix**: Updated mock to properly implement Compartment as a class
- **Impact**: All CodeMirror editor tests now initialize properly

### 2. Animation Test Failures ✅
- **Issue**: `Cannot access 'animation' before initialization`
- **Root Cause**: Circular reference in Web Animations API mock
- **Fix**: Refactored mock to avoid self-referencing promises
- **Impact**: QuickSwitcher and other animation-dependent tests pass

### 3. Test Timeout Issues ✅
- **Issue**: Tests timing out at 30s
- **Fix**: Increased timeout to 60s for unit and integration tests
- **Impact**: Reduced timeout-related failures

## Remaining Issues

### 1. Dialog/Modal Component Tests ❌
- **Affected Files**: Dialog.test.ts, Modal.test.ts, ConfigPanel.test.ts
- **Issue**: Component rendering and event handling failures
- **Count**: ~50 test failures
- **Priority**: High

### 2. ShareDialog Initialization ❌
- **Error**: `Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'length')`
- **Location**: ShareDialog.svelte:398 - `recentPackages.length`
- **Impact**: 18 test failures
- **Priority**: High

### 3. WebSocket Mock Issues ❌
- **Error**: `ws does not work in the browser`
- **Affected**: metrics.test.ts
- **Impact**: Metrics service tests failing
- **Priority**: Medium

### 4. Component Import Errors ❌
- **Files**: Multiple component test files
- **Error**: Transform failures during import
- **Impact**: ~15 test files cannot run
- **Priority**: High

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (This Week)
1. **Fix Dialog/Modal Tests**
   - Update component mocks to handle Svelte 5 events
   - Ensure proper cleanup between tests
   - Add missing event handler mocks

2. **Fix ShareDialog Initialization**
   - Initialize `recentPackages` as empty array
   - Add proper prop defaults
   - Update test setup to provide required props

3. **Update WebSocket Mocks**
   - Mock WebSocket globally in test setup
   - Ensure compatibility with jsdom environment
   - Consider using MSW for network mocking

### Medium Term (Next Sprint)
1. **Component Import Issues**
   - Investigate Vite transform errors
   - Update component test patterns
   - Consider migration to @testing-library/svelte v5

2. **Integration Test Suite**
   - Fix cross-component communication
   - Update store mocks for integration scenarios
   - Add proper async handling

3. **E2E Test Suite**
   - Implement dev server startup in test setup
   - Configure proper port allocation
   - Add smoke test suite

## Success Metrics
- Unit test pass rate > 90%
- Zero transform/import errors
- All test files executable
- Integration tests > 80% pass rate
- E2E smoke tests passing

## Risk Assessment
- **High Risk**: Dialog/Modal failures blocking UI testing
- **Medium Risk**: Integration test failures may hide bugs
- **Low Risk**: Performance tests mostly passing

## Next Steps
1. Continue fixing Dialog/Modal component tests
2. Address ShareDialog initialization issue
3. Update WebSocket mocks for jsdom
4. Create automated test health monitoring
5. Implement CI/CD pipeline with test gates
