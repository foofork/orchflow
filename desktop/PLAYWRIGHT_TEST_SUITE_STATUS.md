# Playwright Test Suite Status Report

## Current State

The existing Playwright test suite has **539 visual tests** but they are currently failing because:

1. **Selector Mismatch**: Tests expect `.app-container` but the app uses `.app`
2. **Component Structure**: The app has been refactored but tests haven't been updated
3. **Missing Elements**: Tests look for elements that may not exist in the current UI
4. **Cleanup Script Conflicts**: The global setup kills processes that Playwright tries to start
5. **Syntax Errors**: Some tests had syntax errors (extra braces) that prevented execution

## What Works

✅ **Port Management**: The new system correctly allocates ports for visual tests (5201-5210)
✅ **Server Startup**: The dev.js script successfully starts servers for Playwright
✅ **Manual Testing**: Both web and desktop modes work perfectly
✅ **Screenshot Capability**: Playwright can capture screenshots when using correct selectors

## What Needs Fixing

### 1. Update Test Selectors

**Current (broken):**
```typescript
await page.waitForSelector('.app-container', { timeout: 10000 });
```

**Should be:**
```typescript
await page.waitForSelector('.app', { timeout: 10000 });
```

### 2. Update Component Tests

Many tests reference components that may have changed:
- `.file-explorer` → May need to check if this still exists
- `.terminal` → Component exists but may have different structure
- `.dashboard` → Lazy loaded, needs different approach

### 3. Modernize Test Approach

The tests should account for:
- Lazy loading of components
- Dynamic UI based on user actions
- Proper wait conditions for SPA behavior

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions

1. **Update app.spec.ts** to use correct selectors (COMPLETED):
```typescript
test('should capture full application layout', async ({ page }) => {
  // Wait for main app container
  await page.waitForSelector('.app', { timeout: 10000 });
  
  // Wait for welcome screen or main content
  await page.waitForSelector('.welcome, .editor-area', { timeout: 5000 });
  
  // Take screenshot
  await expect(page).toHaveScreenshot('app-full-layout.png', {
    fullPage: true,
    animations: 'disabled',
  });
});
```

**Verified Working Fix:**
- Changed `.app-container` to `.app`
- Added wait for `.welcome, .editor-area` to ensure content is loaded
- Fixed syntax error (removed extra closing brace)
- Test now passes and captures screenshots correctly

2. **Create a test utilities file** for common selectors:
```typescript
export const selectors = {
  // Main containers (verified to exist)
  app: '.app',
  welcome: '.welcome',
  editorArea: '.editor-area',
  mainContent: '.main-content',
  
  // UI components (from +page.svelte)
  sidebar: '.sidebar',
  activityBar: '.activity-bar',
  tabBar: '.tab-bar-container',
  statusBar: '.status-bar',
  
  // Content areas
  editorPane: '.editor-pane',
  quickActions: '.quick-actions',
  recentFiles: '.recent-files',
  
  // Interactive elements
  quickActionButtons: '.quick-action',
  splitButtons: '.split-button',
  
  // Component-specific (need to verify)
  terminal: '.terminal-container',
  fileExplorer: '.file-explorer',
  commandPalette: '.command-palette'
};
```

3. **Update test strategy** for lazy-loaded components:
```typescript
// For lazy components, trigger the action first
await page.click('button:has-text("Open Terminal")');
await page.waitForSelector('.terminal-container', { timeout: 5000 });
```

### Long-term Improvements

1. **Add data-testid attributes** to key components for stable test selectors
2. **Create page object models** for complex interactions
3. **Add visual regression baselines** for the current UI
4. **Implement component-level visual tests** instead of full-page screenshots

## Test Execution Summary

- **Total Visual Tests**: 539 across multiple spec files
- **Test Categories**:
  - animations.spec.ts
  - app.spec.ts
  - component-states.spec.ts
  - editor.spec.ts
  - responsive-design.spec.ts
  - terminal.spec.ts
  - theme-switching.spec.ts
  - ui-interactions.spec.ts

## Discovered Issues and Solutions

### 1. Process Cleanup Conflicts
The `global.setup.ts` and `cleanup-test-environment.js` scripts kill all vite processes, including the one Playwright is trying to start.

**Solution Options:**
- Run tests with `PLAYWRIGHT_BASE_URL` set to an already running server
- Modify cleanup scripts to be more selective about which processes to kill
- Use port ranges that don't conflict with manual testing

### 2. Syntax Error in app.spec.ts
The sidebar test had an extra closing brace that prevented the file from parsing.

**Fixed:**
```typescript
// Before (broken)
await page.keyboard.press('Control+B');
  await page.waitForTimeout(300);
  // ... more code
  }
});

// After (fixed)
await page.keyboard.press('Control+B');
await page.waitForTimeout(300);
// ... more code
});
```

### 3. Port Allocation Issues
The port-locks.json file can be wiped by cleanup scripts, causing "No available ports" errors.

**Solution:**
- The port manager works correctly when not interfered with
- Avoid aggressive cleanup during active development

## Verification Process

To verify the fix works:

```bash
# 1. Start a dev server manually
npx vite dev --port 5300 &

# 2. Run a single test with explicit base URL
PLAYWRIGHT_BASE_URL=http://localhost:5300 npx playwright test "app.spec.ts" -g "should capture full application layout" --project chromium --update-snapshots

# 3. Check the generated screenshot
# Located at: tests/visual/app.spec.ts-snapshots/app-full-layout-chromium-linux.png
```

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Fix the immediate selector issues in app.spec.ts (COMPLETED)
2. Update remaining test files with correct selectors
3. Fix cleanup scripts to avoid killing active servers
4. Generate new visual regression baselines
5. Document which selectors map to which components
6. Add data-testid attributes for more stable tests

The infrastructure is solid - the tests just need to be updated to match the current application structure.
