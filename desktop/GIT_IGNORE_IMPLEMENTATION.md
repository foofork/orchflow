# Git Ignore Implementation Summary

## Issue
The `is_git_ignored` command was referenced in `main.rs` but was missing from `git_commands.rs`, along with several other git-related commands.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Added Missing Commands
Implemented the following commands in `git_commands.rs`:

#### `is_git_ignored`
- Checks if a file is ignored by git
- Handles both absolute and relative paths
- Returns false if no git repository exists
- Uses libgit2's `is_path_ignored` method

#### `get_file_git_status`
- Gets git status for a specific file
- Returns appropriate status enum (Untracked, Modified, Added, etc.)

#### `get_all_git_statuses`
- Returns a HashMap of all file paths and their git statuses
- Includes ignored files in the scan

#### `get_git_branch_info`
- Returns current branch information including:
  - Branch name
  - Whether HEAD is detached
  - Upstream branch
  - Commits ahead/behind

#### `has_uncommitted_changes`
- Quick check if repository has any uncommitted changes
- Includes untracked files in the check

#### `has_git_integration`
- Checks if the project root has a .git directory

### 2. Integration with File Manager
The file manager already had git ignore support built-in:
- `FileNode` struct has `is_git_ignored` field
- `GitIntegration` class uses ignore crate for gitignore pattern matching
- File tree building respects gitignore rules

### 3. Architecture
```
Frontend
   ↓
git_commands.rs (Tauri commands)
   ↓
Manager (orchestrator)
   ↓
FileManager → GitIntegration
```

## Usage Examples

### Check if a file is ignored:
```javascript
const isIgnored = await invoke('is_git_ignored', { path: '/path/to/file' });
```

### Get git status for a file:
```javascript
const status = await invoke('get_file_git_status', { path: '/path/to/file' });
// Returns: "untracked", "modified", "added", etc.
```

### Get all git statuses:
```javascript
const statuses = await invoke('get_all_git_statuses');
// Returns: { "file1.js": "modified", "file2.ts": "untracked", ... }
```

## Testing Recommendations

1. Test with various gitignore patterns
2. Test with nested .gitignore files
3. Test with global gitignore
4. Test performance with large repositories
5. Test edge cases (symlinks, case sensitivity, etc.)

## Future Enhancements

1. Add caching for better performance
2. Support for .git/info/exclude
3. Real-time file watcher integration
4. Better error messages for edge cases
