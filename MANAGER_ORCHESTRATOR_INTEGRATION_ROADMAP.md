# Manager + Orchestrator Integration Roadmap

> **Purpose**: Track the integration work between the Rust Manager and TypeScript Orchestrator to enable orchflow's full capabilities.
> **Related**: See [MANAGER_ORCHESTRATOR_ARCHITECTURE.md](./docs/MANAGER_ORCHESTRATOR_ARCHITECTURE.md) for architectural details.
> **Status**: Integration work has NOT started yet - both components exist independently

## Overview

This roadmap tracks the work needed to integrate orchflow's two components:
- **Rust Manager** (Core IDE infrastructure, terminal/file/plugin management, embedded in desktop app)
- **TypeScript Orchestrator** (AI agent coordination, workflow automation, optional service)

### Architecture Decision: Local IPC vs WebSocket

For desktop applications, we'll use **different communication methods** based on deployment mode:
- **Sidecar Mode**: Use stdin/stdout pipes (like LSP) - more efficient for local processes
- **Service Mode**: Use WebSocket - necessary for network communication

This avoids the overhead of TCP/WebSocket for local inter-process communication while maintaining flexibility for remote scenarios.

## Current State (Updated Jan 2025)

### âœ… What Exists
- Rust Manager fully functional with MuxBackend abstraction for terminal/file management
- TypeScript Orchestrator runs independently with AI agent coordination
- Manager WebSocket server (port 7777) **disabled for performance** - will use IPC instead
- Orchestrator has WebSocket server (port 3000) for its own clients
- Clear architectural separation and purpose
- Configuration hooks exist but aren't wired up
- **NEW**: Modular architecture - large files refactored into domain modules
- **NEW**: Zero compilation errors achieved
- **NEW**: SimpleStateStore replacing SQLx for persistence
- **NEW**: Terminal streaming via Tauri IPC (not WebSocket)
- **NEW**: Performance optimized - startup <100ms, memory ~10MB

### ðŸš§ What's Missing 
- No spawning logic to start TypeScript Orchestrator from Manager
- No IPC mechanism for local communication (stdin/stdout, pipes, or local sockets)
- No WebSocket client for remote orchestrator connection
- No handlers on either side for inter-process communication
- No feature detection or capability negotiation
- **CRITICAL**: No real-time terminal output streaming infrastructure
  - PTY management not implemented
  - WebSocket terminal I/O not connected
  - Terminal state synchronization missing

struct OrchestatorProcess {
    child: Child,
    stdin: ChildStdin,
    stdout: BufReader<ChildStdout>,
    rpc_client: JsonRpcClient,
}

impl OrchestatorProcess {
    fn spawn() -> Result<Self> {
        let child = Command::new("node")
            .arg("orchestrator/dist/index.js")
            .arg("--mode=sidecar")
            .stdin(Stdio::piped())
            .stdout(Stdio::piped())
            .stderr(Stdio::piped())
            .spawn()?;
        // Set up JSON-RPC over stdio...
    }
}
```

### WebSocket Design (Service Mode)
```rust
// Rust Manager side
struct OrchestatorClient {
    ws_client: WebSocketClient,
    rpc_client: JsonRpcClient,
}

impl OrchestatorClient {
    async fn connect(url: &str) -> Result<Self> {
        let ws_client = WebSocketClient::connect(url).await?;
        // Set up JSON-RPC over WebSocket...
    }
}
```

- **Adoption**: 50% of users enable Orchestrator features

## Implementation Notes

### Communication Protocols

#### Local IPC (Sidecar Mode)
```typescript
// Over stdin/stdout pipes - like Language Server Protocol
// Manager â†’ Orchestrator (via stdin)
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "method": "orchestrate.route",
  "params": { "command": "run tests" },
  "id": "123"
}

// Orchestrator â†’ Manager (via stdout)
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "method": "manager.createPane",
  "params": { "type": "terminal", "command": "npm test" },
  "id": "456"
}
```

#### WebSocket (Service Mode)
```typescript
// Same JSON-RPC 2.0 protocol but over WebSocket
// Includes connection handshake and heartbeat
```

### Deployment Modes

1. **Manager-only** (default)
   - Core IDE without orchestration
   - No TypeScript Orchestrator running
   - Fastest, lowest resource usage

2. **Sidecar** (local orchestration)
   - Manager spawns Orchestrator as child process
   - Communication via stdin/stdout pipes
   - Orchestrator lifecycle tied to Manager
   - Best for desktop app with AI features

3. **Service** (remote orchestration)
   - Orchestrator runs as separate service
   - Communication via WebSocket
   - Can serve multiple clients
   - Best for team/cloud scenarios

### Priority Order
1. Core integration (Phases 1-2)
2. IDE features (Phase 4.1)
3. Advanced features (Phase 3)
4. Nice-to-have features (Phase 4.3)

## Open Questions

1. Should Manager embed basic orchestration logic?
2. How to handle version mismatches between Manager and Orchestrator?
3. Should plugins declare if they need orchestration?
4. What's the upgrade path for existing users?

## Next Steps

1. Review and approve this roadmap
2. Create detailed technical specifications
3. Set up integration test environment
4. Begin Phase 1 implementation

*Note: This roadmap clarifies that the Rust component is the Manager (infrastructure) and the TypeScript component is the Orchestrator (AI coordination), maintaining both as part of orchflow's flexibility-first philosophy.*
