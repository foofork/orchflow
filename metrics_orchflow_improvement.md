## 3. Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

### 3.1 Primary KPIs
1. **User Success Rate**
   - Formula: Successful operations / Total attempts
   - Target: >95%
   - Measurement: Automated logging

2. **Mean Time to Resolution (MTTR)**
   - Formula: Average time from error to recovery
   - Target: <2 minutes
   - Measurement: System telemetry

3. **Documentation Effectiveness**
   - Formula: (Self-resolved issues / Total issues) × 100
   - Target: >80%
   - Measurement: Support ticket analysis

4. **System Reliability**
   - Formula: Uptime / Total time
   - Target: >99.9%
   - Measurement: Monitoring system

### 3.2 Secondary KPIs
- Feature utilization rate
- User satisfaction score (NPS)
- Performance degradation over time
- Resource efficiency ratio
- Integration success rate

## 4. Measurement Methodology

### 4.1 Automated Metrics Collection
```typescript
interface MetricsCollector {
  // Performance metrics
  trackCommandLatency(command: string, duration: number): void;
  trackWorkerSpawn(workerId: string, duration: number): void;
  trackErrorRecovery(error: string, duration: number): void;
  
  // Usage metrics
  trackUserCommand(command: string, success: boolean): void;
  trackDocumentationAccess(page: string, duration: number): void;
  trackFeatureUsage(feature: string, context: any): void;
  
  // System metrics
  trackResourceUsage(snapshot: ResourceSnapshot): void;
  trackConcurrentWorkers(count: number): void;
  trackSystemHealth(health: HealthCheck): void;
}
```

### 4.2 User Feedback Collection
```yaml
feedback_surveys:
  - type: "post-operation"
    trigger: "after_first_success"
    questions:
      - "How easy was it to complete your task? (1-5)"
      - "Did the documentation help? (Y/N)"
      - "What could be clearer?"
      
  - type: "weekly"
    trigger: "scheduled"
    questions:
      - "Overall satisfaction (1-10)"
      - "Most useful feature"
      - "Biggest pain point"
      - "Feature requests"
```
