# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We release patches for security vulnerabilities. Which versions are eligible for receiving such patches depends on the CVSS v3.0 Rating:

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 0.1.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| < 0.1   | :x:                |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of OrchFlow seriously. If you have discovered a security vulnerability, we appreciate your help in disclosing it to us in a responsible manner.

### Reporting Process

1. **DO NOT** create a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities
2. Email security@orchflow.dev with:
   - Description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Potential impact
   - Suggested fix (if any)
3. You should receive a response within 48 hours
4. We'll work with you to understand and resolve the issue

### What to Expect

- **Acknowledgment**: Within 48 hours
- **Initial Assessment**: Within 1 week
- **Resolution Timeline**: Depends on severity
  - Critical: 1-7 days
  - High: 1-2 weeks
  - Medium: 2-4 weeks
  - Low: Next regular release

## Security Best Practices

### For Users

1. **Keep OrchFlow Updated**
   - Enable auto-updates in settings
   - Check for updates regularly
   - Apply security patches immediately

2. **Secure Your Environment**
   - Use strong system passwords
   - Enable disk encryption
   - Keep your OS updated
   - Use a firewall

3. **Extension Safety**
   - Only install trusted extensions
   - Review extension permissions
   - Report suspicious behavior

### For Developers

1. **Code Security**
   ```rust
   // Never expose sensitive data
   #[tauri::command]
   fn get_config() -> Result<Config, String> {
     let config = load_config()?;
     // Sanitize sensitive fields
     Ok(config.sanitized())
   }
   ```

2. **Input Validation**
   ```typescript
   // Always validate user input
   function processPath(userPath: string): string {
     // Prevent path traversal
     if (userPath.includes('..')) {
       throw new Error('Invalid path');
     }
     return path.normalize(userPath);
   }
   ```

3. **Secure Communication**
   - Use HTTPS for all external requests
   - Validate SSL certificates
   - Implement request timeouts

## Security Features

### Built-in Protections

1. **Process Isolation**
   - Each terminal runs in isolated process
   - Limited IPC between processes
   - Sandboxed file system access

2. **Update Security**
   - Signed update packages
   - Signature verification before install
   - HTTPS-only update channels

3. **Data Protection**
   - Encrypted credential storage
   - Secure session management
   - No telemetry without consent

### Configuration

```json
{
  "security": {
    "enable_auto_updates": true,
    "verify_signatures": true,
    "sandbox_mode": "strict",
    "allowed_protocols": ["https", "wss"],
    "csp_policy": "default-src 'self'"
  }
}
```

## Known Security Considerations

### Terminal Access
OrchFlow provides terminal access, which inherently allows system command execution. Users should:
- Be cautious with scripts from untrusted sources
- Review commands before execution
- Use read-only mode when appropriate

### Extension System
Extensions can extend functionality but may introduce risks:
- Extensions are not sandboxed by default
- Review extension source code when possible
- Limit extension permissions

### Network Features
- WebSocket connections for real-time features
- API endpoints for remote control (when enabled)
- Update checking requires internet access

## Security Checklist

### For Contributors

- [ ] No hardcoded secrets or credentials
- [ ] Input validation on all user data
- [ ] Proper error handling (no stack traces to users)
- [ ] Secure random number generation
- [ ] Path traversal prevention
- [ ] SQL injection prevention (parameterized queries)
- [ ] XSS prevention (sanitize HTML)
- [ ] CSRF protection where applicable

### For Releases

- [ ] Security audit completed
- [ ] Dependencies updated
- [ ] Vulnerability scan passed
- [ ] Release notes include security fixes
- [ ] Binaries signed and notarized

## Vulnerability Disclosure

After a security vulnerability is fixed:

1. **Private Disclosure**: Notify affected users directly if possible
2. **Public Disclosure**: After patch is available:
   - CVE number (if applicable)
   - Affected versions
   - Severity rating
   - Mitigation steps
   - Credit to reporter (with permission)

## Security Tools

### Static Analysis
```bash
# Rust security audit
cargo audit

# JavaScript dependency check
npm audit

# SAST scanning
cargo clippy -- -W clippy::all
```

### Runtime Protection
```rust
// Example: Sanitize file paths
use std::path::{Path, PathBuf};

fn safe_path(base: &Path, user_path: &str) -> Result<PathBuf, Error> {
    let path = base.join(user_path);
    let canonical = path.canonicalize()?;
    
    // Ensure path is within base directory
    if !canonical.starts_with(base) {
        return Err(Error::PathTraversal);
    }
    
    Ok(canonical)
}
```

## Incident Response

In case of a security incident:

1. **Immediate Actions**
   - Assess impact and scope
   - Implement temporary mitigation
   - Notify affected users if needed

2. **Investigation**
   - Determine root cause
   - Identify affected versions
   - Review logs for exploitation

3. **Resolution**
   - Develop and test patch
   - Release security update
   - Update documentation

4. **Post-Incident**
   - Conduct retrospective
   - Update security practices
   - Improve monitoring
