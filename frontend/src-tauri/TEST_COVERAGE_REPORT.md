# Test Coverage Report

## Overview

This report summarizes the current test coverage for the orchflow backend components. While we've made significant progress, compilation issues prevent exact coverage measurement.

## Test Status by Component

### ✅ Working Tests (9/9 passing)
Located in `working_tests.rs`:
- Error construction and handling
- State store integration
- Error serialization
- Type safety validation

### ✅ Performance Tests (Partially working)
Located in `performance_tests.rs`:
- Memory usage baseline (PASS: 9.45MB)
- Other tests blocked by compilation errors

### ⚠️ Tests with Compilation Issues

#### State Manager Tests (`state_manager_tests_v2.rs`)
- Session CRUD operations
- Pane management  
- Settings management
- Concurrent operations
- Shell type detection
- Persistence
**Issue**: API mismatches with StateManager methods

#### Terminal Stream Tests (`terminal_stream_tests.rs`)
- Terminal creation and lifecycle
- Input/output handling
- Key sequences
- Multiple terminals
- Broadcast operations
**Issue**: Missing methods in TerminalStreamManager

#### File Manager Tests (`file_manager_tests.rs`)
- File tree operations
- File CRUD operations
- Directory management
- Search functionality
- Undo/redo operations
**Issue**: API mismatches with FileManager methods

## Coverage Estimates

Based on implemented tests and code analysis:

### High Coverage (>80%)
- SimpleStateStore
- OrchflowError types
- Basic state management

### Medium Coverage (50-80%)
- Manager API
- Terminal streaming backend
- File operations

### Low Coverage (<50%)
- Plugin system
- LSP integration
- Search functionality
- Module system

## Test Infrastructure Achievements

1. **Error System Migration**: Successfully migrated from String to typed errors
2. **Integration Tests**: Created comprehensive integration test framework
3. **Performance Monitoring**: Established performance baselines
4. **Test Organization**: Modular test structure for maintainability

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. Fix API mismatches in test files
2. Enable StateManager, TerminalStream, and FileManager tests
3. Add missing methods to implementations

### Short Term
1. Implement plugin system tests
2. Add WebSocket event tests
3. Create end-to-end integration tests
4. Set up code coverage tools (llvm-cov)

### Medium Term
1. Achieve >85% coverage target
2. Implement property-based testing
3. Add fuzzing for security-critical paths
4. Create performance regression suite

## Technical Debt

### Test-Related Issues
1. Many test files commented out due to compilation errors
2. API drift between tests and implementation
3. Missing test utilities and fixtures
4. No automated coverage reporting

### Fixes Required
1. Update test APIs to match current implementations
2. Add missing methods to core components
3. Create test helper utilities
4. Implement mock Tauri app handle for tests

## Conclusion

While significant progress has been made in establishing a testing framework, compilation issues prevent accurate coverage measurement. The working tests demonstrate solid patterns for error handling and state management. Fixing the compilation issues should be the immediate priority to enable comprehensive testing.
