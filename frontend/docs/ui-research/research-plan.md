# OrchFlow UI/UX Research Plan

## Objective
Design optimal OrchFlow UI for basic and advanced users

## Scope
- **Basic Users**: Developers new to terminal multiplexers
- **Advanced Users**: Power users familiar with tmux/vim
- **Goals**: 
  - Progressive disclosure
  - Mode switching
  - Customization

## Methodology
1. Analyze competitor UIs
2. Identify user personas
3. Propose adaptive interface

## Research Areas

### 1. Competitor Analysis
- tmux (traditional multiplexer)
- VS Code integrated terminal
- Warp (modern terminal)
- Kitty (GPU-accelerated terminal)
- iTerm2 (feature-rich Mac terminal)

### 2. User Personas
- **Basic Developer**
  - New to terminal multiplexers
  - Needs visual cues and discoverable features
  - Prefers mouse interactions
  
- **Power User**
  - Expert in vim/tmux
  - Keyboard-driven workflow
  - Wants minimal UI chrome

### 3. Adaptive Interface Concepts
- Mode switching (basic/advanced)
- Progressive disclosure of features
- Customizable key bindings
- Context-aware help system

## Next Steps
1. Create detailed competitor feature matrix
2. Design wireframes for both modes
3. Implement prototype with mode switching
