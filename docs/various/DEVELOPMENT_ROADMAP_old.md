# Orchflow Development Roadmap

## 📋 Roadmap Maintenance

**When to Update:**
- Task status changes
- New blockers emerge
- Priorities shift
- Features complete

**How to Update:**
1. Update "Current Development Focus" first
2. Move completed work to "Completed Phases"
3. Keep metrics current (performance, coverage)
4. Link relevant documentation
5. **FINISH THE JOB**: No task complete without passing tests

**TDD Requirement:**
- **MANDATORY**: Write tests FIRST, then code
- **Red → Green → Refactor**: Follow TDD cycle
- **>90% Coverage**: Maintain test coverage
- **See**: [Test Strategy Guide](docs/TEST_STRATEGY.md)

**Documentation Discipline:**
- **Roadmap Items** → HERE, not scattered in code comments
- **Architecture Decisions** → docs/architecture/UNIFIED_ARCHITECTURE.md
- **API Changes** → Relevant API docs
- **NO SPRAWL**: Don't document roadmap items in random files

## 🎉 Major Milestone: Phase 5 Complete!

### 🚨 CRITICAL: Test-Driven Development is MANDATORY

**FINISH THE JOB** - No feature is complete without:
1. **Tests Written FIRST** - TDD is not optional
2. **All Tests PASSING** - Red → Green → Refactor
3. **Coverage >90%** - Measure and maintain
4. **CI/CD Green** - No merging with failing tests

> **📖 See [Test Strategy Guide](docs/TEST_STRATEGY.md) for testing approach**
> **📖 See [Contributing Guide](docs/CONTRIBUTING.md) for TDD workflow**

## Current Development Focus 🚧

### ⚠️ TDD Requirements for Active Work
**EVERY feature below MUST follow TDD:**
1. Write failing tests FIRST
2. Implement minimal code to pass
3. Refactor with confidence
4. Document test scenarios

### 🎯 STRATEGIC PRIORITY: Complete the Rust Manager First

#### 🚨 KEY ARCHITECTURAL DECISION: ruv-FANN Integration Mode
**STATUS**: Decision needed before Terminal Metadata System implementation
- **Feature Flag Approach**: Use ruv-FANN as toggle between IPC vs direct integration
- **Performance Impact**: Direct mode eliminates sidecar process overhead
- **Multi-Project Support**: Architecture must support multiple projects/workspaces simultaneously
  - IPC approach: Natural process isolation per project
  - Direct integration: Requires namespace/context isolation design
  - Decision affects scalability and resource management
- **Affects**: Terminal metadata design, agent coordination, process architecture, multi-project support
- **Documentation**: Updated in [Unified Architecture](docs/architecture/UNIFIED_ARCHITECTURE.md)
- **Timeline**: Decision required by Week 4 (Terminal Metadata System phase)

#### Phase 1.0: Test Coverage & Feature Completion (IN PROGRESS) ⚡ CRITICAL


**Phase 1.3:Module System Completion** (Week 3) 
- [ ] WASM plugin loading (future enhancement)
- [ ] Native plugin loading (future enhancement)
- [ ] Security tests for plugin sandboxing (future enhancement)

#### Phase 1.5: Performance tests

- [ ] Search and Replace Performance tests for large codebases

#### Phase 2: Terminal Intelligence & Production (Weeks 4-6)

**Terminal Metadata System & Orchestrator Architecture** (Week 4-5) - AI Foundation
- [ ] **🚨 CRITICAL DECISION NEEDED**: ruv-FANN Integration Architecture
  - **Decision**: Use ruv-FANN as feature flag to replace IPC with direct integration
  - **Impact**: Eliminates orchestrator sidecar process overhead when enabled
  - **Multi-Project Considerations**:
    - MUST support multiple projects/workspaces simultaneously
    - IPC mode: Natural isolation via separate processes per project
    - Direct mode: Requires explicit namespace/context isolation
    - Affects resource pooling and orchestrator lifecycle management
  - **Options**: 
    - OFF: Legacy IPC mode (JSON-RPC over stdio/socket) - stable fallback, easier multi-project
    - ON: Direct integration mode (embedded in Rust process) - performance optimized, complex multi-project
  - **Rationale**: Single process model improves performance, simplifies deployment, eliminates IPC failure modes
  - **Implementation**: Factory pattern with OrchestratorConfig.ruvFANNMode feature flag
  - **See**: [Unified Architecture docs/architecture/UNIFIED_ARCHITECTURE.md] for complete design
- [ ] Research terminal classification patterns (dependent on orchestrator decision)
- [ ] Terminal type classification (Build, Test, REPL, Debug, Agent)
- [ ] AI agent metadata support (affects terminal → orchestrator communication)
- [ ] Purpose-driven terminal management
- [ ] Context tracking per terminal
- [ ] Process lifecycle monitoring
- [ ] Error pattern detection
- [ ] Command intent detection preparation
- [ ] Write comprehensive tests

**Terminal Security Framework** (Week 5) - 🔐 DECISION NEEDED
- [ ] **DECISION REQUIRED**: Choose security implementation approach
  - Option A: Tiered security model (5 levels from unrestricted to isolated)
  - Option B: Individual feature toggles (granular control)
  - Option C: Hybrid approach with tiers + overrides
- [ ] Implement command execution protection
- [ ] Add process isolation options (namespace/container/VM)
- [ ] Integrate workspace trust model
- [ ] Build audit logging framework
- [ ] Create visual security indicators
- [ ] Design plugin sandboxing for terminal access
- [ ] Add rate limiting and resource protection
