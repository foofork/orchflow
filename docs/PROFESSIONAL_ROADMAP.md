# orchflow Professional Development Roadmap

## Executive Summary

orchflow has completed its core infrastructure (Phases 1-7) and now needs strategic enhancements to become a production-ready, AI-driven development environment. This roadmap outlines the critical next steps to achieve professional quality while building toward the unified architecture vision.

## Current State Assessment

### Strengths
- ✅ Solid Rust backend with terminal management
- ✅ Working Tauri desktop application  
- ✅ Clean MuxBackend abstraction
- ✅ Comprehensive error handling system
- ✅ Plugin architecture foundation
- ✅ <100ms startup performance achieved

### Gaps to Production
- ❌ Frontend tightly coupled to Tauri (no web path)
- ❌ No AI integration or orchestration layer
- ❌ Missing Manager ↔ Orchestrator protocol
- ❌ 51 failing tests need resolution
- ❌ Limited production monitoring/telemetry
- ❌ No auto-update or distribution pipeline

## Strategic Priorities

### Phase 1: Foundation for AI & Web (Weeks 1-4)

#### 1.1 Service Abstraction Layer ⚡ CRITICAL
**Why**: Enable 90% code reuse between desktop/web platforms
**Impact**: Unblocks web deployment and AI integration

```typescript
// frontend/src/lib/services/index.ts
export interface Services {
  terminal: TerminalService;
  file: FileService;
  ai: AIService;
  state: StateService;
}

// Platform-specific implementations
- TauriTerminalService (desktop)
- WebTerminalService (web)
- MockTerminalService (testing)
```

**Implementation Steps**:
1. Define service interfaces in `/frontend/src/lib/services/`
2. Create platform detection utility
3. Implement service factory pattern
4. Migrate components to use abstract services
5. Add feature flags for gradual migration

#### 1.2 AI Chat Component Foundation
**Why**: Natural language interface is core to orchflow vision
**Impact**: Creates UX foundation for AI orchestration

```svelte
// frontend/src/lib/components/AIChat.svelte
- Conversational UI with message history
- Intent detection for command routing
- Integration with existing tab system
- Placeholder for future orchestrator connection
- Quick actions and command suggestions
```

#### 1.3 Manager ↔ Orchestrator Protocol
**Why**: Enables AI agents to control terminals
**Impact**: Unlocks multi-agent swarm capabilities

```rust
// frontend/src-tauri/src/orchestrator_bridge.rs
- JSON-RPC 2.0 over WebSocket
- Bidirectional communication
- Event streaming for real-time updates
- Mock orchestrator for testing
- Protocol versioning for compatibility
```

### Phase 2: Production Readiness (Weeks 5-8)

#### 2.1 Test Suite Recovery ⚡ CRITICAL
**Current**: 51 failing tests / 139 total
**Target**: 100% passing, >90% coverage

Priority fixes:
1. xterm.js canvas rendering mocks
2. Tauri app handle in unit tests
3. Component integration test setup
4. E2E test infrastructure

#### 2.2 Error Handling & Recovery
**Why**: Production apps need graceful degradation
**Components**:
- Orchestrator unavailability handling
- Terminal session crash recovery
- Network interruption resilience
- User-friendly error messages
- Error reporting telemetry

#### 2.3 Monitoring & Telemetry
**Why**: Can't improve what you don't measure
**Implementation**:
```rust
// frontend/src-tauri/src/telemetry.rs
- OpenTelemetry integration
- Custom metrics for:
  - Startup time tracking
  - Memory usage monitoring
  - Terminal operation latency
  - Plugin performance
  - Error rates and types
```

### Phase 3: Distribution & Updates (Weeks 9-10)

#### 3.1 Auto-Updater Pipeline
**Components**:
- Code signing certificates
- Delta update generation
- Rollback capability
- Update UI notifications
- Staged rollout support

#### 3.2 Release Pipeline
```yaml
# .github/workflows/release.yml
- Multi-platform builds (macOS, Windows, Linux)
- Automated testing before release
- Binary signing and notarization
- GitHub releases with changelogs
- Update server deployment
```

### Phase 4: AI Integration Preparation (Weeks 11-12)

#### 4.1 Orchestrator Scaffold
**Location**: `/orchestrator/` (new)
```typescript
// orchestrator/src/index.ts
- TypeScript project setup
- Manager client implementation
- Basic agent framework
- Command adapter system
- Development mode with hot reload
```

#### 4.2 Terminal Metadata System
**Why**: AI agents need context about terminals
```rust
// frontend/src-tauri/src/terminal_metadata.rs
pub struct TerminalMetadata {
    id: String,
    terminal_type: TerminalType, // Build, Test, REPL, Debug, Agent
    purpose: String,
    agent_id: Option<String>,
    context: HashMap<String, Value>,
}
```

## Implementation Timeline

### Month 1: Foundation
- **Week 1-2**: Service abstraction layer
- **Week 3**: AI Chat component
- **Week 4**: Manager-Orchestrator protocol

### Month 2: Quality
- **Week 5-6**: Fix all tests, achieve >90% coverage
- **Week 7**: Error handling improvements
- **Week 8**: Telemetry implementation

### Month 3: Production
- **Week 9**: Auto-updater setup
- **Week 10**: Release pipeline
- **Week 11-12**: AI integration prep

## Success Metrics

### Technical Metrics
- ✅ 100% test pass rate
- ✅ >90% code coverage
- ✅ <100ms startup maintained
- ✅ <10MB memory base
- ✅ Zero critical production bugs

### Architecture Metrics
- ✅ 90% code shared between platforms
- ✅ Clean service abstractions
- ✅ Orchestrator protocol defined
- ✅ Plugin system production-ready

### User Experience
- ✅ Natural language commands work
- ✅ Graceful error handling
- ✅ Seamless updates
- ✅ Responsive UI (<50ms interactions)

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
1. **Service Abstraction Complexity**
   - Mitigation: Incremental migration with feature flags
   - Fallback: Maintain backward compatibility

2. **Test Suite Debt**
   - Mitigation: Fix tests before new features
   - Enforcement: CI blocks PRs with failing tests

3. **Performance Regression**  
   - Mitigation: Continuous benchmarking
   - Monitoring: Telemetry alerts for degradation

### Timeline Risks
1. **Scope Creep**
   - Mitigation: Feature freeze during test fixes
   - Focus: Core functionality over new features

2. **Integration Complexity**
   - Mitigation: Mock implementations first
   - Validation: Integration tests for protocols

## Next Actions

### Immediate (This Week)
1. Create `/frontend/src/lib/services/` directory structure
2. Define TerminalService interface
3. Implement platform detection
4. Create service factory
5. Migrate one component as proof of concept

### Short Term (Next Month)
1. Complete service abstraction layer
2. Build AI Chat component
3. Design orchestrator protocol
4. Fix critical test failures

### Medium Term (3 Months)
1. Launch with auto-updater
2. Beta program for AI features
3. Web platform proof of concept
4. Plugin marketplace planning

## Conclusion

orchflow has strong technical foundations but needs strategic enhancements to become production-ready. The service abstraction layer is the critical first step, enabling both web deployment and AI integration. By focusing on quality (tests, errors, monitoring) before features, orchflow will achieve its vision of being a professional, AI-driven development environment.

The key insight: **Build toward the AI vision while keeping current functionality stable and performant.**
