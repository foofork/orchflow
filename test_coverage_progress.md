## Next Steps to Reach 90% Coverage

### Phase 1: State Management Tests (Est. +5-6% coverage)
1. Test store initialization and state mutations
2. Test subscriptions and reactivity
3. Test persistence mechanisms

### Phase 2: Service Layer Tests (Est. +4-5% coverage)
1. Test metrics collection and aggregation
2. Test terminal IPC communication
3. Test theme loading and switching

### Phase 3: UI Component Tests (Est. +50-55% coverage)
1. Test major dashboard components
2. Test terminal components
3. Test git integration
4. Test file management components

### Phase 4: Integration Tests (Est. +5% coverage)
1. End-to-end workflows
2. Component interaction tests
3. Full user journey tests

## Estimated Timeline
- **State Management**: 1-2 days
- **Services**: 1 day
- **UI Components**: 4-5 days
- **Integration**: 1-2 days
- **Total**: 7-10 days to reach >90%

## Recommendations
1. Continue with state management tests next (highest impact for effort)
2. Focus on components with most business logic
3. Use existing test patterns as templates
4. Consider parallel test writing for UI components
5. Add integration tests last to catch edge cases
