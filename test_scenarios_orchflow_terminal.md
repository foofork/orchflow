1. Spawn multiple workers
   - Expected: All workers start successfully
2. Mass pause operation
   - Command: "Pause all analysis tasks"
   - Expected: All relevant workers pause
3. Selective resume
   - Command: "Resume only the critical tasks"
   - Expected: Correct workers resume
4. Force kill scenario
   - Command: "Kill the stuck worker"
   - Expected: Clean shutdown, resources freed

**Validation Criteria**:
- Worker spawn time < 3 seconds
- State consistency across operations
- Resource cleanup on termination
- No zombie processes
