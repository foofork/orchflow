# OrchFlow Implementation Status

## ✅ Completed Components

### 1. NPM Wrapper Package (@orchflow/claude-flow)
- **Location**: `/packages/orchflow-claude-flow/`
- **Features**:
  - Smart command interception (`claude-flow orchflow` vs pass-through)
  - Binary download mechanism for Rust components
  - Platform-specific binary detection
  - Post-install setup
  - TypeScript implementation with full type safety

### 2. Primary Terminal (70% Width)
- **Location**: `/packages/orchflow-claude-flow/src/primary-terminal/`
- **Components**:
  - `orchflow-terminal.ts` - Main terminal orchestration
  - `nl-intent-recognizer.ts` - Natural language processing
  - `conversation-context.ts` - Context tracking
  - `worker-namer.ts` - Descriptive naming system
  - `mcp-client.ts` - MCP protocol client
  - `orchestrator-client.ts` - WebSocket client
  - `status-pane.ts` - 30% status display
  - `worker-access-manager.ts` - Worker connections

### 3. Natural Language Features
- Intent recognition for:
  - Task creation ("build X", "implement Y")
  - Worker management ("connect to worker", "pause X")
  - Status queries ("list workers", "show progress")
  - Quick access (press 1-9 for workers)
- Context-aware descriptive naming:
  - "Auth System Builder" for authentication tasks
  - "API Developer" for API endpoints
  - "Test Engineer" for testing tasks
  - And many more contextual names

### 4. Tmux Integration
- **Location**: `/packages/orchflow-claude-flow/src/tmux-integration/`
- Full tmux backend wrapper
- Session and pane management
- 70/30 split-screen layout
- Pane title management

## 🔧 In Progress

### 5. Orchestrator/Manager Service ✅
- **Location**: `/packages/orchflow-claude-flow/src/orchestrator/`
- **Completed**:
  - `orchflow-orchestrator.ts` - Main orchestrator
  - `task-graph.ts` - Dependency management with cycle detection
  - `worker-manager.ts` - Claude-flow worker lifecycle management with tmux support
  - `mcp-server.ts` - MCP protocol server with WebSocket and stdio transports
  - `state-manager.ts` - Persistent state management with snapshots
  - `smart-scheduler.ts` - Intelligent task scheduling with learning capabilities
  - `claude-flow-wrapper.ts` - Seamless claude-flow command integration
  - `conflict-detector.ts` - Resource conflict detection and prevention

## 📝 Architecture Highlights

### Thin Wrapper Approach
```typescript
// Command interception - minimal overhead
if (args[0] === 'orchflow') {
  // Launch OrchFlow terminal
  await launchOrchFlow(args.slice(1));
} else {
  // Pass through to real claude-flow
  const claudeFlow = spawn(claudeFlowPath, args);
}
```

### Worker Naming Intelligence
```typescript
// Context-aware descriptive names
"build authentication system" → "Auth System Builder"
"create user API endpoints" → "User API Developer"
"optimize database queries" → "Database Optimizer"
```

### Natural Language Processing
```typescript
// Flexible intent recognition
"Create a REST API for user management"
→ Intent: create_task
→ Type: code
→ Worker: "User API Developer"

"Connect to the API developer"
→ Intent: connect_to_worker
→ Fuzzy match: finds "User API Developer"
```

## 🚀 Usage

### Installation
```bash
npm install -g @orchflow/claude-flow
```

### Launch OrchFlow
```bash
claude-flow orchflow
```

### Natural Language Commands
- "Build a React component for user profiles"
- "Show me all workers"
- "Connect to the frontend developer"
- "Pause the test runner"
- Press 1-9 to quickly access workers

### Regular claude-flow Commands
```bash
# All standard commands work unchanged
claude-flow swarm "analyze codebase"
claude-flow sparc run developer "add tests"
claude-flow memory store key "value"
```
