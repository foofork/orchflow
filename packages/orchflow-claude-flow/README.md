# @orchflow/claude-flow

ðŸš€ **OrchFlow Terminal Architecture** - Natural language orchestration for claude-flow

A smart NPM wrapper that adds natural language orchestration capabilities to claude-flow while preserving all existing functionality.

## Installation

```bash
npm install -g @orchflow/claude-flow
```

## Usage

### Launch OrchFlow Terminal (Natural Language Interface)

```bash
claude-flow orchflow
```

This launches the OrchFlow terminal with:
- **70% Primary Terminal**: Natural language interface for task management
- **30% Status Pane**: Live worker monitoring with descriptive names
- **Quick Access**: Press 1-9 to instantly connect to workers
- **Smart Orchestration**: Automatic task scheduling and worker management

### Regular claude-flow Commands (Pass-through)

All standard claude-flow commands work exactly as before:

```bash
claude-flow swarm "build authentication system"
claude-flow sparc run developer "add unit tests"
claude-flow memory store mykey "important data"
# ... all other claude-flow commands
```

## How It Works

### Smart Command Interception

The wrapper intercepts only the `orchflow` command:

```
claude-flow orchflow     â†’ Launch OrchFlow Terminal
claude-flow [anything]   â†’ Pass to real claude-flow
```

### Thin Wrapper Architecture

```
User Input
    â†“
@orchflow/claude-flow (this package)
    â†“
    â”œâ”€â”€ "orchflow" command? â†’ OrchFlow Components
    â”‚                         â”œâ”€ Primary Terminal
    â”‚                         â”œâ”€ Orchestrator
    â”‚                         â”œâ”€ Worker Manager
    â”‚                         â””â”€ Status Pane
    â”‚
    â””â”€â”€ Other command? â†’ Real claude-flow
```

### Component Management

OrchFlow components are downloaded on first use:

```
~/.orchflow/
â”œâ”€â”€ components/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ orchflow-terminal      # Primary terminal UI
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ orchflow-orchestrator  # Task orchestration
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ orchflow-worker        # Worker processes
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ orchflow-status        # Status pane
â””â”€â”€ config.json                # User configuration
```

## Natural Language Examples

In OrchFlow terminal, you can use natural language:

```
âž¤ Create a REST API for user management
âœ“ Task created: "REST API Developer" worker spawned

âž¤ Show me all workers
[1] REST API Developer      ðŸŸ¢ Running (45%)
[2] Database Architect      ðŸŸ¢ Running (80%)
[3] Test Engineer          ðŸŸ¡ Paused

âž¤ Connect to the API developer
âœ“ Connected to "REST API Developer"

âž¤ Press 2
âœ“ Connected to "Database Architect"
```

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

```bash
CLAUDE_FLOW_PATH=/custom/path/to/claude-flow  # Real claude-flow location
ORCHFLOW_HOME=~/.orchflow                     # OrchFlow data directory
ORCHFLOW_PORT=3000                           # Orchestrator port
ORCHFLOW_STATUS_WIDTH=30                     # Status pane width (%)
ORCHFLOW_MAX_WORKERS=10                      # Maximum concurrent workers
```

### Programmatic Usage

```typescript
import { initializeOrchFlow, launchOrchFlow } from '@orchflow/claude-flow';

// Configure OrchFlow
await initializeOrchFlow({
  orchestratorPort: 3000,
  statusPaneWidth: 30,
  enableQuickAccess: true,
  maxWorkers: 10
});

// Launch programmatically
await launchOrchFlow(['--verbose']);
```
