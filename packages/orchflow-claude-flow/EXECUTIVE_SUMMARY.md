# OrchFlow Executive Summary

## Overview
OrchFlow is a groundbreaking natural language orchestration system that injects advanced workflow capabilities directly into Claude conversations through the Model Context Protocol (MCP). The system transforms how developers interact with AI by providing seamless orchestration without disrupting the natural conversation flow.

## Key Innovation: Injection-Based Architecture
Unlike traditional orchestration systems that require separate interfaces or complex command structures, OrchFlow injects orchestration capabilities directly into Claude's conversation context. Users simply describe what they want to build, and Claude naturally coordinates parallel work streams behind the scenes.
